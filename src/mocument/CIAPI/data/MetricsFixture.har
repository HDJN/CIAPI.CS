Through this partnership, KPN enables its customers access to get global WiFi coverage in countries such as the Belgium, France, UK and Japan. Moving forward, Fon aims to have over 50 million shared connections in its international network within a couple of years to the benefit of KPN customers. \\n  - The public WiFi network will enable access in and around houses where shared connections are operational. The public WiFi network therefore is complementary to KPN's mobile and fixed network with over 1,500 HotSpots in the Netherlands. \\n  - KPN expects to test the WiFi network within the next half year. The commercial launch is planned for later in 2012. \\n  - By Amsterdam Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; amsterdam@dowjones.com \\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 02:44 ET (07:44 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539242,\"Headline\":\"KPN Partners With Fon For Offering Access To WiFi Hotspots\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358927040000)\\/\"}}"

Quartal um 3 Prozent \\n  -- Siemens Aufträge übersteigen nach drei Quartalen wieder den Umsatz \\n  -- Siemens-Boss Löscher erwartet keinen Rückenwind von der Weltwirtschaft \\n  (NEU: Details, Kommentare) \\n  Von Ursula Quass und Archibald Preuschat \\n  MÜNCHEN--Deutschlands größter Industriekonzern Siemens hat im laufenden Geschäftsjahr noch einige Herausforderungen vor sich, auch wenn sich nach dem ersten Quartal ein leichter Silberstreif am Horizont abzeichnet. \\n  In den drei Monaten von Oktober bis Dezember wurden neue Aufträge im Wert von 19,14 Milliarden Euro gebucht, das sind 3 Prozent weniger als im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Zahl kommt besondere Bedeutung zu, gibt sie doch eine Indikation für die künftige Umsatzentwicklung. \\n  Immerhin, bei den neuen Aufträgen schneidet Siemens etwas besser ab, als von den Analysten erwartet. Zudem liegt der Auftragseingang erstmals seit drei Quartalen wieder über dem Umsatz. \\n  Siemens-Boss Peter Löscher spricht zwar von einem \\\"soliden Start\\\" in das Geschäftsjahr, das am 30. September endet. Von der Weltwirtschaft, die für den Erfolg des Industriekonglomerats so wichtig ist, erwartet sich Löscher jedoch \\\"keinen Rückenwind\\\". \\\"Die Stimmung in Europa hat sich in der zweiten Hälfte von 2012 zwar ein Stück weit beruhigt, doch die Wirtschaftsleistung der Eurozone wird aller Voraussicht nach noch einmal zurückgehen. Die Prognosen der Konjunkturforscher für die USA sind noch sehr verhalten,\\\" sagte Löscher auf einer Pressekonferenz in München, wo sich am Vormittag auch die Aktionäre zur Hauptversammlung treffen. \\n  Siemens hält am Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr jedoch fest:  Bei einem \\\"moderaten\\\" Auftragswachstum soll sich der Umsatz weiter dem Niveau des vergangenen Geschäftsjahres von 78,3 Milliarden Euro annähern. Der Gewinn aus fortgeführten Aktivitäten soll 4,5 bis 5 Milliarden Euro betragen. \\n  Im Dezember-Quartal  stieg der Umsatz um 2 Prozent auf 18,13 Milliarden Euro. Der Nettogewinn ging auf 1,2 nach zuletzt 1,4 Milliarden Euro zurück. Auch hier war am Markt weniger erwartet worden. Die Marge im operativen Geschäft stieg von 9,0 auf 9,3 Prozent. \\n  Um 2014 eine Marge von 12 Prozent zu erreichen, hat der Industriekonzern im vergangenen Jahr ein 6 Milliarden Euro schweres Sparprogramm aufgelegt. Das kostet aber auch: Mit 50 Millionen Euro wurde im ersten Quartal erst ein Bruchteil der Gesamtkosten von 1 Milliarde Euro gebucht, ein Zeichen dafür, dass die Maßnahmen erst langsam in Angriff genommen werden können. Verteilt auf die vier Sektoren des Konglomerates wird der Löwenanteil, nämlich 400 Millionen Euro bei der Industrie anfallen. 300 Millionen Euro sind es bei der Energie und 240 Millionen beim Sektor Infrastruktur und Städte. Im Gesundheitswesen fallen die Belastungen mit 80 Millionen Euro indes bescheiden aus. \\n  Sorgenkinder bleiben vor allem die Sektoren Infrastructure & Cities sowie Industry. Hier gingen die Auftragseingänge um 7 beziehungsweise 1 Prozent zurück. Auch die Margen schrumpften. Dagegen konnte der Konzern in den Bereichen Energie und Healthcare die Margen steigern. \\n  Belastet hat im abgelaufenen Quartal insbesondere die verspätete Auslieferung der ICE-Züge an die Deutsche Bahn und der Ausstieg aus dem Solar-Gechäft, in das man erst vor ein paar Jahren teuer eingestiegen war. Insgesamt summierten sich die Belastungen im Quartalsausweis auf über 200 Millionen Euro, gleichwohl weniger als im Vorjahr. \\n  Gute Nachrichten gab es auch außerhalb des Kerngeschäfts, der Netzwerkausrüster Nokia Siemens Networks, ein Joint Venture mit der finnischen Nokia, spülte 51 Millionen Euro in die Siemens-Kasse, im Vorjahresquartal lieferte das Joint Venture keinen Ergebnisbeitrag. \\n   Insgesamt bleibt Siemens aber wieder einmal hinter Konkurrenten wie dem US-Mischkonzern General Electric zurück. Dieser hatte unlängst einen leichten Anstieg bei den Aufträgen vermeldet, nachdem diese zwei Quartale in Folge zurückgegangen waren. Der Umsatz legte um 7,5 Prozent, das Ergebnis um 12 Prozent zu. Auch der französische Wettbewerber Alstom überzeugte mit seinen in dieser Woche vorgelegten Zahlen. Der niederländische Wettbewerber Philips legt seine Zahlen erst am Dienstag vor. \\n  Löscher gestand ein, dass Siemens in den zurückliegenden Quartalen \\\"an Boden verloren hat. Dass wir aufholen wollen, ist unzweifelhaft,\\\" fügte Löscher hinzu. \\n  Analyst Heino Ruland von Ruland Research sieht in den vorgelegten Zahlen  keinen Grund, in Euphorie auszubrechen. Per Saldo seien zwar niedrige Erwartungen übertroffen und das Vorjahresquartal teils übertroffen worden: \\\"Aber die Quartalsvergleiche sind hier schlecht\\\", sagt Ruland: \\\"Das Vorjahresquartal war schlecht gelaufen und das jetzige sieht dadurch nicht besser aus\\\". \\n  Kontakt zum Autor: archibald.preuschat@dowjones.com und ursula.quass@dowjones.com \\n  DJG/apr/kla \\n  (Weitere Berichte und Analysen zu aktuellen Wirtschafts- und Finanzthemen finden Sie auf www.WSJ.de, dem deutschsprachigen Online-Angebot des Wall Street Journal.) \\n  Order free Annual Report for Siemens AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0007236101 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\n  Order free Annual Report for Siemens AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US8261975010 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 02:38 ET (07:38 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539240,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: Siemens steht vor weiteren Herausforderungen\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358926680000)\\/\"}}"

However, the focus this session will be squarely on the U.K. \\n  \\\"As the situation in Europe has continued to remain dormant and equity markets have pushed to multi-year highs, markets have started to turn their attention to the precarious fiscal position of the U.K., and the evidence is that they aren't particularly happy with what they see, after yesterday's [Tuesday's] numbers showed that the Chancellor looks set to miss his borrowing targets by some distance,\\\" said Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, in a research note. \\n  In an early speech in London, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to say that, if re-elected, a Conservative government will renegotiate the U.K.'s relationship with the European Union, and then hold a referendum on the new settlement in the first half of its five-year parliamentary term. \\n  The minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy committee's latest meeting will be released later, as well as U.K. unemployment figures. \\n  Ahead of the stock markets' opening, CMC Markets is calling the FTSE 100 up 21 at 6200, the DAX up 18 at 7714 and the CAC-40 up 11 at 3752. The euro is weaker all round, German Bund futures have opened higher, crude oil futures are modestly lower and the gold price is little changed. \\n  Looking ahead, figures are due on French business confidence and euro-zone consumer confidence. Portugal is expected to issue 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of five-year debt, the International Monetary Fund will release updates to its World Economic Outlook and the World Economic Forum kicks off in Davos. \\n  Write to Martin Essex at martin.essex@dowjones.com or on Twitter @MartinEssexDJN \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 02:27 ET (07:27 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539237,\"Headline\":\"European Stocks Expected Higher; Focus on UK\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358926020000)\\/\"}}"

Stewart \\n \\n  MELBOURNE--The government of Australia's Northern Territory has asked Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) to hold off from closing its Gove alumina refinery while it seeks natural gas supplies to replace fuel that it is willing to divert to the mining company to power the operation. \\n  The company, however, Wednesday said it needs a clear and unconditional commitment from the government and is continuing with its review of the operation. \\n  Terry Mills, chief minister of the territory, said the government had written to Rio Tinto and the Australian arm of energy company Eni SpA (E) to say it is prepared to release a volume of gas for use by the refinery provided a replacement source can be found. \\n  \\\"We believe more time is needed to ensure that a replacement gas supply is found and the Northern Territory's electricity supply is not put at risk,\\\" Mr. Mills said in a statement. \\n  Rio Tinto's Pacific Aluminium unit, which houses assets the company plans to exit when possible, in October launched a review of its Gove bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Nhulunbuy to consider, among other things, switching to lower-cost gas from heavy fuel oil. \\n  Earlier this month, Rio Tinto said a decision on whether to continue operating the refinery or to \\\"mothball\\\" it would be taken in late January. \\n  Sandeep Biswas, chief executive of Pacific Aluminium, said the company would continue working with the government and other parties to try and secure an agreement on gas supplies by Jan. 31. The refinery has been making significant losses for a number of years despite billions of dollars in investment, he said. \\n  \\\"We are prepared to enter a commercial contract for gas supply, fund the conversion of the refinery and pay a gas tariff that would repay the cost of the pipeline,\\\" Mr. Biswas said, adding the company wasn't seeking a handout or subsidy from the territory or federal governments. \\n  There are roughly 1,400 employees and contractors working at Gove. \\n  Write to Robb M.

Core operating income is expected to decline in mid-single digits. \\n  \\\"After our 2013 patent expirations are behind us, our relentless focus on innovation, growth, and productivity is expected to result in group net sales growth of at least mid-single digits in both 2014 and 2015, with core operating income growing ahead of sales,\\\" Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said in a statement. \\n  Net profit for the three months to the end of December rose to $2.05 billion from $1.18 billion in the same period a year earlier, below analysts' expectations of $2.38 billion. Last year, fourth-quarter profit was dented by one-time writedowns, including a $900 million charge prompted by lowered expectations for sales of Tekturna, a hypertension pill. \\n  Net sales for the quarter were flat at $14.83 billion, beating analyst expectations. \\n  Sales at the flagship pharmaceutical division were flat at $8.3 billion, with Diovan sales dropping 25% to $992 million. The drug, which was Novartis's top seller in 2011, generated $5.67 billion in sales that year. \\n  Novartis also said Daniel Vasella, who has served as chief executive and chairman for 17 years, won't stand for re-election to the board when it meets next month. \\n  Novartis shares closed at CHF60.10 Tuesday. \\n  Write to marta.falconi@dowjones.com \\n  Order free Annual Report for Novartis AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=CH0012005267 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\n  Order free Annual Report for Novartis AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US66987V1098 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 01:52 ET (06:52 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539224,\"Headline\":\"Novartis Wary on 2013, Expects to Return to Growth Next Year\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358923920000)\\/\"}}"

We are very well positioned to achieve our 2015 goals,\\\" said SAP Co-Chief Executives Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe in a press release. SAP targets EUR20 billion in revenue in 2015, but earlier this month, Mr. Snabe said the target will be revised upwards, without giving details. \\n  For the full year, SAP targets software and cloud subscriptions revenue rise between 14% and 20%, after reaching EUR5 billion in 2012. Around EUR750 million should come from cloud subscriptions and support revenue. It guides on a non-IFRS and constant currencies basis. \\n  SAP competes with Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) to help some of the world's largest companies including Ford Motor Co. (F), and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) manage their sales, costs, customers and staff. The company has made a rapid turnaround since 2009 when profits were hit by the economic crisis and it was forced to cut several thousand jobs. To improve its fortunes, the firm turned to new technologies, focusing on Big Data, offering fast search and analysis of databases; mobile, enabling access to business information via smartphones and tablets; and Cloud Computing, where software services can be accessed via the Web, cutting installation costs. \\n  With the focus on cloud computing, SAP changed its company structure last year, dividing the company into two main divisions: cloud business and On Premise business for traditional software installed on customer computers. \\n  Net profit growth was smaller than Oracle's 18% rate in its September-to-November fiscal quarter. Oracle is also benefiting from rising demand for cloud software. But the German firm did better than Salesforce.com, another cloud competitor, whose loss widened in the August-to-October period due to higher costs and a tax impact. Microsoft reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, \\n  SAP last week said its fourth quarter revenue rose 12% to EUR5.02 billion slightly below the EUR5.17 billion average prediction of eight analysts. Operating profit declined 5% to EUR1.59 billion, hit by a EUR151 million acquisition-related charge and staff share-related pay which soared to EUR185 million, from EUR1 million in 2011 due to a sharp rise in its share price. \\n  SAP shares surged 33% over the past 12 months to EUR57.82 on Tuesday's close, in line with improved earnings. \\n  Write to Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 01:50 ET (06:50 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539223,\"Headline\":\"SAP Gives 2013 Guidance As After-Tax Profit Falls\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358923800000)\\/\"}}"

(APA) said it has shut in its offshore Stag and Van Gogh oil fields. \\n  Most coastal operations are likely to resume early the next day, based on the current outlook, although ship loading would depend on sea conditions, a spokesman for Rio Tinto said. \\n  To the northeast at Port Hedland, the port authority said it would resume shipping operations later Wednesday as the worst of the storm passes. The port was closed the day before as the storm approached. \\n  The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood warning for Pilbara, but said the storm system is expected to weaken overnight as it cross the coast. Although the remnants of cyclone Peta may move back off the west Pilbara coast later in the week, it isn't expected to redevelop into a tropical cyclone, it said. \\n  Write to Robb M.

Siemens said the charges reflected delays in the delivery of high-speed trains, sanctions on Iran as well as costs of its latest restructuring program. \\n  Order intake in the period fell to EUR19.14 billion from EUR19.79 billion a year earlier. First-quarter revenue, however, rose 2% to 18.13 billion euros while operating profit gained 4% to 1.7 billion euros. \\n  \\\"For the rest of the year as well, we don't expect any tailwinds from the global economy,\\\" said Peter Loescher, chief executive of the company whose products range from high-speed trains, wind turbines, to power plants and medical scanners. \\n  Mr. Loescher faces questions from shareholders at the Siemens annual meeting later Wednesday as the German company's operating performance and corporate governance are coming under intense scrutiny from investors. \\n  Mr. Loescher is banking on a restructuring plan in which the company will jettison underperforming businesses and slash 6 billion euros ($7.66 billion) in costs over the next two years to improve profitability having underestimated the sluggishness of growth in Europe, still Siemens' main market. \\n  Siemens' share price has performed less well than its nearest rivals in Europe like ABB Ltd. of Switzerland, Royal Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, and Schneider Electric SA of France in recent months because of uncertainty about how quickly it will improve its profit margins. \\n  \\\"Siemens has had some serious problems in commercial risk management and in my view, portfolio management,\\\" said Martin Prozesky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \\\"They tend to buy assets too expensively, failing to improve their performance and to deliver synergies and then sell them badly,\\\" Mr. Prozesky said, speaking ahead of Siemens' first-quarter results announcement. \\n  Write to Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@dowjones .com and Archibald Preuschat at archibald.preuschat@dowjones.com \\n  Order free Annual Report for Siemens AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0007236101 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\n  Order free Annual Report for Siemens AG\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US8261975010 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 01:15 ET (06:15 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539209,\"Headline\":\"Declining Orders at Siemens Indicate Weak Business Ahead\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358921700000)\\/\"}}"

(500520.BY) and BAE Systems PLC (BAESY) are reviewing their defense joint venture in India to see if any changes are needed, the two companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. \\n  Mahindra, India's largest maker of sport-utility vehicles by sales, and U.K.-based BAE said that there has been a \\\"significant evolution\\\" in the Indian market for land systems since the establishment of their joint venture in 2009. \\n  The Defence Land Systems India joint venture -- 74%-owned by Mahindra and the rest by BAE -- makes special military vehicles at a facility on the outskirts of New Delhi. The facility was also to be used to make artillery guns for the Indian Army. \\n  \\\"Developments in both the industry environment and in customer procurement frameworks and acquisition strategies have led the shareholders to institute a strategic review of the business,\\\" the statement said. \\n  \\\"This review will assess any changes necessary to address the evolving market and to meet emerging customer requirements,\\\" it added. \\\"No decision has yet been taken on the way forward.\\\" \\n  The two companies didn't elaborate on their plans. \\n  Khutub Hai, chief executive at Mahindra Defence Systems, a division of Mahindra & Mahindra, declined to comment when contacted. \\n  In addition to BAE, Mahindra has a joint venture with U.S.-based Telephonics Corp. a unit of Griffon Corp. (GFF), to make radar systems in India, and another with U.A.E.-based Arabia Holdings and Ras Al Khaimah Transport Investments LLC to make and sell armoured vehicles in the Middle East and Central Asia as well as in Africa. \\n  Write to Santanu Choudhury at santanu.choudhury@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 23, 2013 00:57 ET (05:57 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539206,\"Headline\":\"Mahindra & Mahindra, BAE Systems Review India Defense Joint Venture\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358920620000)\\/\"}}"

Stewart \\n \\n  MELBOURNE--Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) is reviewing its troubled coal business in Mozambique, and may put it up for sale or bring in a partner that can help build infrastructure needed to get material to port, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. \\n  The Anglo-Australian mining company hasn't set any timeframe for completing the review, which comes in the wake of a US$3 billion writedown on the Mozambique assets acquired from Australia-listed Riversdale Mining Ltd. in 2011, the person said. No advisors have been appointed to help with the process. \\n  Rio Tinto's 3.9 billion Australian dollar (US$4.1 billion) acquisition of Riversdale Mining  was aimed at growing its coking coal division and lessening the company's reliance on iron ore for revenue and earnings. Last week's writedown--alongside an US$11 billion impairment charge against its aluminum assets--forced Chief Executive Tom Albanese and head of strategy Doug Ritchie to step down Jan. 17. \\n  Rio Tinto last week said the development of infrastructure to support coal mining is more challenging than originally anticipated. Together with a reduction in estimates for recoverable coking coal volumes, this has led to a reassessment of the overall scale and ramp-up schedule for the site, it said. \\n  Rio Tinto had originally sought to transport coal by barge along the Zambezi River, but was forced to consider a new rail line to the coast after being blocked from using the river by Mozambique's government. \\n  The company is discussing transportation options with the government, which has received a number of proposals from companies developing mines in the country. The person said Rio Tinto's review will consider ways it could build greater infrastructure scale in partnership with other companies. \\n  Rio Tinto began exporting coking coal from its Benga mine in Mozambique's Moatize Basin in June, with a first shipment of 34,000 metric tons destined for an Indian steel mill. Vale SA (VALE) and Anglo American PLC (AAL.LN) have coal assets in the same region as Rio Tinto's Benga mine, in which Tata Steel Ltd. (500470.BY) has a 35% stake. \\n  Analysts say the writedown is effectively an admission Rio Tinto overpaid for the Mozambique assets, with the book value now cut to less than A$900 million. Analysts at Macquarie in a recent research report estimated the carrying value was now close to zero. UBS said the size of the impairment raised questions about the due diligence process behind the Riversdale deal. \\n  Sam Walsh, head of Rio Tinto's iron ore division and chief executive for Australia, was named to replace Mr. Albanese. \\n  -Write to Robb M.

The five-day meeting brings together thousands of business leaders, political leaders, intellectuals and journalists. \\n  This year, it's the euro zone -- possibly the biggest threat to global financial stability -- that is likely to be in focus again. Greece again last month only narrowly averted a national bankruptcy with another bailout. Ireland and Portugal are still supported by bailout funds and there are lingering concerns that Italy and Spain could again be in danger if the crisis flares up again. \\n  With many U.S. companies having already reported final-quarter results, several big name CEOs have crossed the Atlantic to join world leaders to discuss current affairs. J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon and UBS AG (UBS) Chairman Axel Weber will kick off Wednesday morning in a session on the banking sector and its constraints. \\n  With the Nordic earnings agenda still relatively thin, focus will be on fourth quarter figures from the likes of  Germany's engineering conglomerate Siemens AG (SI) and U.S. fast food giant McDonald's Corp.

(GOOG) posted fourth-quarter results Tuesday that reflected enduring strength in its core business and something of a rebound in online advertising prices, helping send the Internet company's shares higher in late trading. \\n  Google said its fourth-quarter profit improved 6.7% over the period last year, as the weight of its recent, $12.4 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility lightened somewhat. \\n  Still, analysts still have reservations about the online search firm's increasing presence in lower-margin businesses such as Motorola's mobile devices. Nevertheless, Google's shares rose nearly 5% in late trading. \\n  Later this week, focus turns to large Nordic companies reporting fourth-quarter earnings, including Nokia Corp.

Sparbank expects an increase of 10 basis points, from negative 0.2% to negative 0.1%, as likely, as the panic over Southern Europe has decreased. \\n  It added that \\\"investors have started taking their money [out of] safe havens such as Danish bonds,\\\" and noted that the Danish krone is at its lowest point against the euro since 2006. The deposit rate has been at negative 0.2% since July 2012. \\n  Citigroup's Scandie trader in London Tuesday noted that investors that are long in EUR/SEK and EUR/NOK are likely getting frustrated by to the lack of upside in both crosses. \\n  Citi said there is resistance for EUR/SEK at 8.72, which is proving formidable, and favors selling EUR/SEK at 8.6850 for a test of 8.64. Meanwhile, the bank said EUR/NOK supply at 7.48 is hindering rallies. \\n  As for data on Wednesday, Denmark's consumer confidence indicator, due to be published at 0800 GMT, is seen improving to minus 2 in January from minus 4.7 in December. \\n \\nSTOCK INDEXES: \\n \\nOMXN40  1105.46   -0.19   -0.02% \\nOMXS30  1139.15   -3.94   -0.34% \\nOBX      429.26   -2.78   -0.64% \\nOMXC20   535.31   +0.54   +0.10% \\nOMXH25  2359.17  +12.45   +0.53% \\n \\nBrent  $112.34    -0.08   -0.1% \\n \\nNORDIC MARKETS: \\n  The German ZEW economic expectation index showed business confidence in Germany reached a near three-year high in January, giving a boost to European stocks after initial losses on Tuesday. Despite the rise in prices, stock markets in Europe closed slightly down on the day on low trading volumes. \\n  \\\"Clearly, everybody is in wait-see-mode before the earnings season truly kicks off,\\\" said Eero Farkkila, an equity strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. \\n  In the U.S., the earnings season started in earnest on Tuesday with seventeen S&P 500 companies releasing their 2012 earnings. Among them were several blue chips, such as Google Inc. (GOOG), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN). \\n  Apple Inc. (AAPL) is due to release first quarter earnings for its 2013 fiscal year late Wednesday after markets close, and Nokia Corp. (NOK) will release its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday. \\n  After Nokia pre-announced parts of its results earlier in January, there is considerably less excitement about this earnings release. However, some key figures remain unknown such as net cash and gross margins; also whether Nokia will pay shareholders a dividend. \\n  \\\"The current consensus expectation is a EUR0.05 dividend per share, but for example Nordea forecasts Nokia to forego dividend payment for fiscal 2012,\\\" Nordea's Mr. Farkkila said. \\n  As for net cash, there are reasons to assume a stronger-than-expected performance has translated to cash and that Nokia's liquidity has improved. \\n \\nENERGY: \\n  Crude-oil futures were slightly lower in Asian trade Wednesday, after settling around a four-month high in floor trade on strong U.S. equities. Oil is supported by some positive data from Europe, with Germany's business confidence numbers rising to a near three-year high, even though U.S. data were less positive. \\\"We are continuing to view the macro factor as a bullish consideration for now, which is why we are cautioning against short positions on rallies,\\\" energy consulting firm Ritterbusch and Associates said. But it said Nymex crude above $96/bbl and Brent above $112/bbl are excessive. Nymex crude was down 7c at $96.61/bbl, Brent was off 8c at $112.34/bbl. \\nNEWS ROUNDUP: \\n  DENMARK sold 825 million kroner ($147.2 million) of 2023 inflation-linked bonds at a negative yield at its latest auction Tuesday, the Danish central bank said.  At the auction of the 0.1% coupon bonds there was a bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, of 3.63 and the bonds were sold at an average yield of -0.16%. \\n  FINLAND'S state treasury said it will auction up to 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion) in a 15-year government bond at an auction Jan. 29. The bond on offer is a reopening of an existing issue. \\n  SWEDEN: Hexagon AB (HEXA-B.SK), the Swedish measurement technology company, said that it has entered an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares in Russia-based Navgeocom. \\n  SWEDEN: Sweden's National Debt Office said it will borrow 100 billion Swedish kronor ($15.3 billion) on behalf of the country's central bank, the Riksbank. The Riksbank late last year asked the NDO for SEK100 billion to boost foreign exchange reserves, to be able to provide Swedish banks with liquidity in foreign currencies. \\n  NORWAY: Polish state-controlled gas monopoly PGNiG SA (PGN.WA) said Wednesday that Chief Financial Officer Slawomir Hinc has resigned from his job to run the company's upstream operations in Norway. \\n  Write to Sven Grundberg at sven.grundberg@dowjones.com; Twitter: @svengrundberg \\n  (Juhana Rossi in Finland contributed to this report.) \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 22:24 ET (03:24 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539180,\"Headline\":\"NORDIC MORNING BRIEFING: Davos Summit, U.S. Earnings in View\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358911440000)\\/\"}}"

The decree makes an exception for more than 100 drugs deemed to be essential for patient care, including Doxil and other cancer drugs, which Ben Venue may continue to manufacture. \\n   Ben Venue has had numerous quality lapses including unsanitary conditions at its Bedford, Ohio, plant, some of which were flagged in about 35 FDA inspections dating to 1997, the government said in a court filing. Ben Venue has issued 40 product recalls since 2002, the government said. \\n  Ben Venue's woes led to a chronic shortage of J&J's Doxil treatment for ovarian and other cancers beginning in mid-2011. J&J, which used Ben Venue as its sole supplier for Doxil, placed hundreds of patients on a waiting list for the drug. J&J's Doxil sales tumbled 79% to $83 million for 2012. \\n  J&J has cleared the waiting list and has begun to replenish the Doxil supply. \\n  The U.S. accused Ben Venue of violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by introducing adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. Ben Venue agreed to the entry of the consent decree without admitting or denying the government allegations. \\n  Under the decree, which is subject to approval by U.S. District Court in the northern district of Ohio, Ben Venue said it is permitted to continue drug development activities, and may file applications to manufacture generic drugs. Ben Venue may receive FDA approval for generic drugs and other products if its remediation efforts progress to the agency's satisfaction. \\n  Ben Venue, which specializes in sterile injectable drugs, said it has invested more than $300 million to upgrade its facilities and address the manufacturing-related issues that caused the company to halt manufacturing at its Bedford plant in November 2011. \\n  Ben Venue said it has demonstrated progress in improving manufacturing processes, and has resumed production on multiple manufacturing lines since October 2012. \\n  Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 21:57 ET (02:57 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539170,\"Headline\":\"Ben Venue Signs Consent Decree with FDA Over Drug Manufacturing Problems\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358909820000)\\/\"}}"

Republicans said that such Democratic characterizations were irresponsible and unfairly implied the country might not pay its bills. \\n  \\\"America will pay its debts,\\\" said Rep. Kevin Brady (R, Texas.) \\\"I hope those who choose to be melodramatic about it...if you could please stop, that would be helpful.\\\" \\n  \\\"Nobody on this side of the aisle is talking about default--none of us is talking about default,\\\" said Rep. Charles Boustany (R, La.) \\n  Republicans came close to being criticized by one of the panel's own witnesses at the Tuesday hearing, as the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said that it was \\\"frightening and also hard to believe that we're having this conversation in general.\\\" Simon Johnson, the former IMF chief economist, also urged the committee to \\\"take the debt ceiling off the table\\\"--the same call being made by Democrats. Of plans to prioritize some obligations in the event the U.S. runs out of options for dealing with its debt limit--something promoted by some Republicans, he said that \\\"I don't think these plans are detailed worked out credible plans...--they're vague notions.\\\" \\n  Rep. Jim McDermott (D., Wash.) said that the hearing itself could prove damaging by exposing the dysfunction of the Congress. \\n  \\\"The simple talking about it here is destructive,\\\" Mr. McDermott said. \\\"The whole point of society is to run a government in order to make order for people...this hearing is about how to create chaos.\\\" \\n  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) had a retort, which he delivered after the markets had closed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at its highest level since Dec. 10, 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at its highest level since Dec. 26, 2007. \\n  \\\"This discussion may not be as harmful as we think,\\\" Mr. Camp said. \\\"The Dow and S&P 500 just hit a five-year high today.\\\" \\n  Write to Siobhan Hughes at Siobhan.hughes@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 20:55 ET (01:55 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539140,\"Headline\":\"U.S. Congress Prepares for Next Debt-Ceiling Fight\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358906100000)\\/\"}}"

While these decisions were broadly within market expectations, concern that the open-ended program will not begin until 2014 provided a catalyst for the yen to firm up. \\n  The dollar was recently at Y88.68. \\n  The snapback in the yen pulled Japanese stocks lower, with the Nikkei down 0.7%. The stronger currency weighed on local exporters: Toyota Motor lost 0.8%, while Canon Corp. was 0.6% lower. \\n  More broadly, regional markets were supported by a strong performance on Wall Street Tuesday, which came back online after closing for a public holiday on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a fresh multi-year high after DuPont and Travellers released better-than-expected earnings. \\n  The regional earnings season is about to come into full swing, as large companies from both South Korea and Japan are set to report over the next week. \\n  South Korea's Kospi added 0.1%, with Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics up 2.1% and 0.7% respectively ahead of their earnings reports later in the week. \\n  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3%, with major miner BHP Billiton up 1.2% after the company reported its first-half production number that showed continuing strong growth, the consecutive half-year production and sales record. \\n  -Write to Daniel Inman at daniel.inman@wsj.com \\n  TALK BACK: We invite readers to send us comments on this or other financial news topics.

Stewart \\n \\n  MELBOURNE--Shrugging off volatile iron ore prices, BHP Billiton (BHP) continues to produce and sell record volumes of the steelmaking raw material and says it remains on track to lift output by about 5% this financial year from its mines in Australia's Pilbara region. \\n  BHP and other major producers are racing to expand their capacity to meet demand from China, the world's biggest consumer of iron ore. The spot market price for the commodity fell sharply in just a few months to a near three-year low in September, forcing mining companies to reconsider expansion plans and shed jobs in an effort to protect balance sheets. The price has climbed about 70% since, but remains volatile. \\n  The company said it achieved a 12th consecutive half-year production and sales record in the six months through December, keeping it on track to lift output to 183 million metric tons in the financial year to June 30. Second-quarter production of iron ore was 3% higher at almost 42.2 million tons. \\n  Melbourne-based BHP said the infrastructure was now in place to lift its export capacity at its port in Western Australia to 220 million tons a year from 188 million in the December quarter. The expansion of its Jimblebar mine in the Pilbara is set to begin producing in early 2014. BHP has more than US$7 billion in expansion work underway at its Western Australia iron ore unit. \\n  Iron ore miners such as BHP, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AU) and Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) continue to bet on China's demand for iron ore continuing unabated at a time when some commodity analysts and banks question the strength of the market. Citibank in research published this month warned that China's economy will become less dependent on commodities including base metals. \\n  \\\"Both the overall slowing and the restructuring of the Chinese growth model should mark a watershed in global commodity markets, if only because China has played such an outsized role in these markets over the past decade,\\\" said the bank in the research note. \\\"Chinese growth is likely to be much less energy and commodity intensive than it has been following huge increases in fixed asset investment and industrial production.\\\" \\n  Still, BHP expects to deliver average 10% volume growth to the end of the 2014 financial year thanks to growth across its broader portfolio of commodities and what it says is latent capacity at a number of its highest margin businesses. \\n  \\\"It was a pretty solid set of results across BHP's major commodities,\\\" said Glyn Lawcock, an analyst at UBS in Sydney. The half-year results support the view the company will meet its targets for the year, with the possibility it could do slightly better in iron ore, he said. \\n  Driven by growth from the shale oil and gas assets BHP bought in 2011 for about US$17 billion, petroleum production for the second quarter was up 3% year-on-year at 59.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. The company said that underpinned its forecast output for the year of 240 million barrels, a rise of almost 8% on the year before. \\n  Petroleum, which accounted for about 18% of revenue in the last year against 31% for iron ore, is expected to be a greater driver of earnings in the years ahead as prices for minerals like iron ore ease as the mining industry increases supplies. BHP said it expects to spend US$4 billion on onshore U.S. drilling and development this financial year, with most of that focused on key shale deposits. \\n   BHP's production of metallurgical coal used in steel production was up 5% on the year at almost 8.9 million tons in its second quarter, with a recovery in sales from mines in Australia's eastern Queensland state following a protracted labor dispute offset by the closure of an unprofitable mine and planned plant outages at its South Walker Creek and Goonyella operations. BHP forecast a substantial fall in unit costs at its Queensland operations in the second half of the financial year as productivity improves. \\n  Among other commodities, quarterly output of energy coal was 8% higher than a year ago but aluminum production fell 5% and nickel was down 10%. The company said the strength of the Australian dollar and weak prices continued to put pressure on its alumina and nickel operations. Copper production was 5% higher on the year, and BHP said its majority-owned Escondida mine in Chile is set to boost output by 20% this financial year. \\n  Write to Robb M.

In December 2011, the index was 0.67. \\n  November's component numbers had been strong due to industrial-production numbers jumping after pentup demand following superstorm Sandy. \\n  The more-representative, three-month moving average inched to -0.11 from -0.13, the 10th month in a row the number has remained negative, though it has shown steady improvement. \\n  An index reading of zero indicates economic growth at historical trend levels. A negative number indicates below-average growth and a positive number shows above-average growth. \\n  The monthly slip came as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee was fine-tuning its economic policies. In December, the committee discussed ending the economic-support program known as quantitative easing in 2013, according to FOMC minutes released in early January. \\n  The index tracks 85 separate indicators from across the economy including nonfarm payrolls, civilian employment, building permits and housing starts. \\n  These indicators are grouped into four component parts, two of which had positive readings. The contribution from sales, orders and inventories improved to -0.01, up from -0.06. Employment related indicators rose to 0.09 from -0.02, as civilian employment rose by 28,000 in December after decreasing by 51,000 in November.

              "text": "{\"NewsDetail\":{\"Story\":\"\\n  By Nicholas Winning \\n  LONDON--Prime Minister David Cameron Wednesday pledged to hold a referendum on whether the U.K. should remain a member of the European Union within two and a half years of the next general election, which is due in 2015. \\n  In advanced extracts of his eagerly awaited address on his vision of the future of the 27-nation bloc, Mr. Cameron will say that if re-elected, a Conservative government would renegotiate the U.K.'s relationship with the EU, and then hold a referendum on the new settlement in the first half of its five-year parliamentary term. \\n  The prime minister will say that he believes \\\"very deeply\\\" that the U.K.'s national interest is best served in a flexible, adaptable and open EU, and such an EU would be best with the U.K. in it. But it is time for British people to have their say on the issue, and time to settle the European question in British politics, he will say. \\n  \\\"And when we have negotiated that new settlement, we will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the EU on these new terms; or come out altogether. It will be an in-out referendum,\\\" he will say. \\n  The speech--which some say could prove to be one of the most important addresses yet of Mr. Cameron's premiership--risks unsettling business leaders, officials from Europe and the U.S., and even ministers from the coalition government, who have all warned in recent days of the risks to the British economy and status of any effort to renegotiate the U.K.'s relationship with the EU and a referendum on the EU membership. \\n  However, a referendum will depend on the Conservatives turning around their deficit in the polls before the next general election. The latest YouGov snapshot of voting intentions, based on a survey of 1,675 adults on Jan. 20-21, puts the Conservatives on 33%, behind the main center-left Labour party on 42%. The centrist Liberal Democrats, the smaller party in the coalition with the Conservatives, trails on 10%. \\n  Even if the Conservatives win, some may still doubt Mr. Cameron's word after he failed to honor his previous \\\"cast-iron guarantee\\\" before the last general election to hold an EU referendum. \\n  The speech extracts don't say what areas of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU that a Conservative government would seek to renegotiate. Lawmakers from Mr. Cameron's party have suggested a range of powers they would like to seize back from EU institutions including employment, crime, and justice. \\n  Mr. Cameron will acknowledge that although some people believe that pointing out that public disillusionment with the EU was at an all-time high creates uncertainty for business and raises a question mark over the U.K.'s place in the bloc, ignoring it won't make it go away. \\n  \\\"Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put--and at some stage it will have to be--it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU,\\\" he will say. \\n  Mr. Cameron was scheduled to give the speech in Amsterdam on Friday but postponed it to deal with the attack and hostage crisis at an Algerian gas facility, in which scores of workers were killed, including some Britons. \\n  The latest extracts added to some that were released to journalists last Thursday before the address was put off. In his speech Mr. Cameron will say Britain wants to play a committed and active role in a reformed EU, but several difficult challenges must be faced, including the euro-zone crisis, a lack of competitiveness and public support in the EU, and giving British people a say over the U.K.'s membership. \\n  He will set a vision for a new EU build on five principles: competitiveness, flexibility, power flowing back to and not just away from member states, democratic accountability, and fairness. \\n  \\\"If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit,\\\" he will say. \\\"I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success. And I want a relationship between Britain and the EU that keeps us in it.\\\" \\n  Although the prime minister has framed his speech as part of a wider debate across Europe about the future of the bloc, commentators suspect it is being driven as much by events at home. Mr. Cameron has been under significant pressure from euroskeptics in his center-right Conservative party to call a national referendum on the U.K.'s membership of the bloc, some of whom want the U.K. withdraw from the bloc altogether. \\n  Mr. Cameron will acknowledge that British people feel the EU is heading in a direction they never signed up to and they resent the interference from what are seen as unnecessary EU rules and regulations. \\n  But although he will say \\\"democratic consent for the EU in Britain is now wafer thin,\\\" he will say, \\\"I believe in confronting this issue - shaping it, leading the debate not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.\\\" \\n  But Mr. Cameron reiterated that it would not be good for Britain or Europe to hold an in-out referendum immediately because the EU that emerges from the euro-zone crisis will be a different body from now, perhaps transformed beyond recognition by the measures to save the single currency area. \\n  \\\"We need to allow some time for that to happen--and help to shape the future of the European Union, so that when the choice comes it will be a real one,\\\" he will say. \\n  A poll by YouGov for the Sunday Times suggested British views on the U.K.'s role in the EU may be moving in Mr. Cameron's favor. The survey of 1,912 British adults last week found 40% wanted the U.K. to remain in the EU and 34% wanted to leave. In a similar poll held earlier in January, 36% wanted to stay in and 42% wanted to withdraw, while in November the contrast was even starker, with only 30% wanting in and 51% wanting out. \\n  Write to Nicholas Winning at nick.winning@dowjones.com \\n-0- \\n \\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 19:01 ET (00:01 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539112,\"Headline\":\"UK Cameron: Conservatives Would Hold In-Out EU Referendum\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358899260000)\\/\"}}"

Last year, the providers invested about $500 million. Cable-TV penetration in Mexico is at about 40% versus about half that a decade ago, he added. \\n  Canitec represents fixed-cable TV providers but not pay-TV firms that use satellite dishes. Mr. Puente said satellite providers might grow even faster than cable firms because they can reach people in areas that cable-TV providers may not be able to. \\n  Mr. Puente said his group continues to oppose the granting of a pay-TV concession to the telephone company Telmex. He said Telmex's telephone concession prohibits it from providing television for reasons of competition. \\n  Telmex is a unit of America Movil SAB (AMX, AMOV, AMX.MX), Latin America's biggest wireless provider controlled by businessman Carlos Slim. Telmex is seeking authorization to offer television, arguing that it has met the conditions set out in a 2006 agreement. \\n  Mexico's biggest cable-TV provider is the nation's biggest broadcaster, Grupo Televisa SAB (TV, TLEVISA.MX), which is controlled by Emilio Azcarraga Jean. Televisa has a 50% stake in cellular phone company Iusacell, in partnership with Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who controls the No. 2 broadcaster in the country, TV Azteca SAB (AZTECA.MX), and cable company TotalPlay. \\n  The Mexican telephone and television moguls have been battling over the telecommunications market in recent years, as TV companies expand into phone and Internet service and America Movil aims for a foothold in the television segment. \\n  Write to Laurence Iliff at laurence.iliff@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 18:23 ET (23:23 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539094,\"Headline\":\"Mexico Cable-TV Industry Group Sees Subscriber Growth of 7% This Year\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358896980000)\\/\"}}"

The IPC also closed at record highs in the previous three sessions. \\n  The peso ended stronger against the U.S. dollar, quoted at MXN12.6310, according to Infosel, compared with Monday's close of MXN12.6930. \\n  Banorte said in a research note that it recommends long dollar positions starting at MXN12.60, with an objective of MXN12.90 and stop-loss at MXN12.40. That position was bolstered by the central bank's shift in tone from hawkish to dovish last week, Banorte said. \\n  In local stocks, the B shares of Santander Mexico (SANMEX.MX, BSMX)rose 2.5% to MXN42.40, and the UBD shares of Coca-Cola bottler and convenience-store operator Femsa (KOF.MX, KOF) added 2.2% to MXN137.88. \\n  The L shares of Latin America's largest wireless provider America Movil (AMX.MX, AMX) gained 1.2% to MXN15.75, and the V shares of Mexico's biggest retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX, WMMVY)fell 1.9% to MXN40.28. America Movil and Wal-Mart de Mexico are the most heavily weighted issues in the IPC, respectively. \\n  During the trading day, stocks swung in and out of negative territory, but within a narrow range. Soft U.S. data on existing-home sales for December and manufacturing in the central Atlantic region this month were followed by earnings reports by Travelers (TRV) and DuPont (DD) that were seen as lifting U.S. benchmarks like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. \\n  Mexico sends 80% if its exports to its northern neighbor, giving U.S. economic developments strong sway in local markets. \\n  Write to Laurence Iliff at laurence.iliff@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 17:39 ET (22:39 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539078,\"Headline\":\"Mexico Stocks Edge Up to Record Close; Peso Firms Vs.

Stewart \\n \\n  MELBOURNE--BHP Billiton (BHP) Tuesday forecast a substantial fall in unit costs at its coal operation in Australia's Queensland state in the second half of the financial year after it closed two unprofitable mines and increased productivity at the operation. \\n  The Anglo-Australian company, the world's biggest exporter of steelmaking metallurgical coal by sea, has struggled in recent years with flooding in Queensland and a long-running labor dispute at several mines it owns in the state jointly with Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.TO) that was only resolved in October. Like other producers, it has been forced to shed workers and rethink expansion projects after a slump in commodity prices and a rise in costs last year. \\n  BHP said production of metallurgical coal across its mines rose 5% on the year in the final three months of 2012, but was down 1% on the prior quarter. Sales from the Queensland operations were 30% higher on the quarter, but this was offset by plant outages at its South Walker Creek and Goonyella operations and the closure of the Gregory mine, it said. \\n  Output of iron ore, which has been the biggest driver of earnings at BHP in recent years, was up 3% on the year in the December quarter and the company said it was on track to lift production in the year through June by 5% to about 183 million metric tons. Total production of petroleum products for the latest quarter was 3% higher than a year ago, and BHP said it continued to target 240 million barrels of oil equivalent for the financial year. \\n  Write to Robb M.

              "text": "{\"NewsDetail\":{\"Story\":\"\\n  (Adds details and background throughout) \\n \\n   By Eva Szalay \\n  The currency-trading arm of Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI.T, TRI) has found itself at the center of a dispute over high-speed trading after one multitrillion-dollar client stopped feeding prices to the system to protest the way the trading platform dealt with a rival's tactics. \\n  London-based GSA Capital Partners LLP--which says it traded a notional value of $15 trillion in mostly foreign-exchange flows in 2011, making it one of the world's biggest nonbank market-making firms--said it has stopped sending prices to Thomson Reuters's trading systems until its confidence is restored. \\n  The incident shows that high-speed flows aren't only a challenge to human traders, they also pose a challenge to trading systems at the core of the $4-trillion-a-day global foreign-exchange market. \\n  The move by GSA, itself a high-speed trader, is a protest against what it sees as overly lenient sanctions handed out to rival Lucid Markets, which was investigated by Thomson Reuters last year amid suspicions it had linked up to several servers at once to snag an unfair advantage over rivals. According to people familiar with the matter, Reuters suspended Lucid Markets after concluding it had broken the rules, though that wasn't made public. \\n  \\\"Thomson Reuters's failure to sanction the offender publicly has damaged confidence in the platform and in Thomson Reuters's ability to provide a level playing field for all participants,\\\" a spokesman for London-based GSA said in an interview. \\n  Thomson Reuters, which competes with Dow Jones Newswires for news and information services, declined to comment on GSA's decision to suspend price posting. \\n  GSA hasn't stopped trading on Thomson Reuters's systems entirely; it still trades on prices that other banks and funds post as market makers. But it has stopped pumping prices into the platform for other traders to use, slashing the volumes it sends to the system. It is unclear what portion of its usual flows have been pulled from Thomson Reuters. \\n  The issue dates back to trades conducted by Lucid Markets, part-owned by FXCM Inc. (FXCM), last summer. According to Thomson Reuters documents viewed by Dow Jones in October, Reuters opened an investigation into whether Lucid Markets had broken its rules by hooking up to several servers at once, rather than to one, helping it to place bets fractions of seconds ahead of its competitors. \\n  Lucid Markets denied at the time it had broken any rules. It declined to comment for this article. \\n  According to an email sent by officials at Thomson Reuters and seen by Dow Jones, Thomson Reuters concluded that Lucid Markets did break Thomson Reuters's rules. \\n  In December, Thomson Reuters said it had completed its studies into the firm's tactics, declaring it had taken \\\"appropriate action.\\\" In January, it added the matter was \\\"closed.\\\" \\n  But for GSA--a sizable client widely courted by banks and trading systems--that didn't go far enough. \\n  \\\"The integrity of an unregulated market depends on its operator treating all participants equally and dealing robustly with any breaches,\\\" GSA's spokesman said. \\\"We understand this investigation centered on a market participant's preferential access to the platform, in breach of the Thomson Reuters Matching Rulebook, over several months. This access adversely affected the financial performance of many market makers on the platform.\\\" \\n  Thomson Reuters says it has dealt with the matter satisfactorily. \\n  \\\"Thomson Reuters takes any breaches of its rule book seriously,\\\" the firm said earlier this month. \\\"In the case of a violation of our rule book, appropriate action could include a suspension from trading on our platform for an appropriate period of time. The removal of a firm's access to a primary market for any period of time is a severe penalty,\\\" said Alan Duerden, a spokesman for Thomson Reuters in an emailed statement. \\n  Two people familiar with the matter said Lucid Markets' suspension has ended, even though the investigation closed as recently as Dec. 28. \\n  Lucid Markets is one of the top three customers of Thomson Reuters in terms of volumes, one of those people said. Lucid Markets said in June that it traded $13.4 trillion of foreign exchange in 2011. \\n  A spokesman for Lucid Markets declined to elaborate on the outcome of the Thomson Reuters investigation into its methods. \\n  \\\"Both Lucid Markets and FXCM hold all matters of business between our companies and all our business partners confidential and decline to comment,\\\" said a spokesman for Lucid Markets and FXCM in an emailed statement. \\n  The argument comes as trading rules in most asset classes have been severely tightened to avoid a rerun of the financial crisis that reached its peak in 2008. But institutional currency trading, including the most basic spot trading favored by high-speed accounts, isn't regulated by the U.K.'s Financial Services Authority or the U.S.'s Securities and Exchange Commission. \\n   In the U.K., the Financial Services Authority has authority over eight recognized investment exchanges in the U.K., but the list doesn't include any of the largest foreign-exchange-trading venues, such as Thomson Reuters or its rival, ICAP PLC (IAP.LN, IAPLY)-owned EBS, both of which see around a $100 billion going through their platform on an average day. \\n  EBS has also faced allegations by its traditional bank client base of favoring some customers over others, and discontent about trading conditions on the platform, in the past. In response to widespread criticism and loss of market share, the system tweaked its rules last July and increased its surveillance operations to better keep track of what its customers are doing. \\n  \\\"We have put in place systematic surveillance processes, where we now monitor all activity on our platform hourly and daily and sometimes in real time,\\\" Nichola Hunter, global head of product management at EBS, said in an interview. \\n  \\\"Clear abuse is very easily identifiable, and we would take swift action and send a clear message that we don't tolerate such behavior. If a client unfairly gained advantage on the platform we would be perfectly within our rights to bar them from the system.\\\" \\n  A founder of soon-to-be launched rival trading platform TraFXPure also said it would block access to traders who breach its trading rules. \\n  \\\"We built our platform to limit the possibility of clients breaking the rules,\\\" said Campbell Adams, the founder of the project. \\\"However, if rules are materially broken, TraFX will block access to the system. In our view, this is a much more effective deterrent.\\\" \\n  A similar dispute in the equities market led to the SEC's fining an exchange for the first time in its history. In September last year, the SEC hit NYSE Euronext with a $5 million penalty for distributing market data more slowly to some market participants than others. \\n  \\\"Improper early access to market data, even measured in milliseconds, can in today's markets be a real and substantial advantage that disproportionately disadvantages retail and long-term investors,\\\" Robert Khuzami, the SEC's enforcement director, said in statement at the time. \\n   Write to Eva Szalay at eva.szalay@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 17:09 ET (22:09 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539066,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: Thomson Reuters at Center of High-Speed-Trading Squabble\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358892540000)\\/\"}}"

In emerging economies, traders are keeping a close eye on South Africa, India and Poland, which could cut rates in reaction to measures adopted by other central banks. \\n  Tuesday, the Bank of Japan unveiled a new asset-purchase program that disappointed market participants, leading to a selloff in Asian stocks. \\n  Turkey's central bank continued to ease monetary policy by lowering its overnight borrowing rate to 4.75% from 5%, and its overnight lending rate to 8.75% from 9%, while holding its one-week benchmark interest rate steady at 5.5%. The central bank's hope is to restrict recent currency gains and limit speculative flows into the currency. \\n  \\\"This may alleviate some of the concerns about European growth, but we need to see hard economic data show improvement not just sentiment,\\\" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. \\n  The recent rally of the lira, which hit a 10-month high against the dollar last week, prompted exporters to call for the central bank to intervene and support exports, which have been the biggest factor in Turkey's economic rebalancing. \\n  The dollar rallied on the Tuesday decision, trading at TRY1.7693, up 0.28% on the day, according to CQG data. The lira is expected to remain rangebound in coming months, according to Brown Brothers Harriman analysts. \\n  Currencies in emerging Europe took Turkey's lead and weakened despite better-than-expected business-sentiment data from Germany. Among them, the Hungarian forint was down nearly 0.4% on the day to the euro, at HUF294. \\n  Meanwhile, other emerging-market currencies were buoyed by a revival of support for a potential bill to extend the U.S. borrowing authority until May. \\n  The Mexican peso gained 0.38% to trade at MXN12.6594 to the dollar. \\n  \\\"Currencies with closer trading relationships with the U.S. are benefiting from the U.S. recovery and better outlook,\\\" Ms. Harajli said. \\n  In India, an import tax on gold pushed the rupee to a three-month high against the U.S. dollar. But month-end demand for the dollar from oil importers erased the strength of the move. The rupee recently was trading at INR53.72 to the dollar, from INR53.38 earlier in the day. \\n  Emerging-market debt issuance opened to a busy week. \\n  Peru's BBVA Banco Continental (CONTINC1.VL) is in the market with a $300 million, 3.5-year term deal, while South Korea's Shinhan Bank sold $350 million of 5.5-year notes at a yield of 2.030%. Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVNDA.BO), Colombia's third-largest bank by assets, is raising $500 million in five-year bonds priced at around 225 basis points over comparable Treasury yields. The bank's pricing has firmed up by more than 50 basis points since its launch, and comes on the same day the sovereign looks to sell $1 billion of 10-year bonds. \\n  Some of these deals haven't priced yet. \\n  Write to Prabha Natarajan at prabha.natarajan@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 17:05 ET (22:05 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539064,\"Headline\":\"Turkish Lira Retreats; Other Emerging European Currencies Follow\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358892300000)\\/\"}}"

Japan's central bank also raised its inflation target to 2% from 1%, a move that was widely expected ahead of the meeting. \\n  However, the BOJ statement still sent the yen higher as it disappointed market participants who expected more immediate BOJ action. The BOJ's open-ended easing program does not begin until 2014, and the BOJ also failed to specify a concrete timeline for reaching its new inflation target. \\n  \\\"Given the lofty expectations in the run up to the BOJ meeting, the measures that were announced fell a bit short of expectations,\\\" said Robert Lynch, a currency strategist at HSBC in New York. \\\"If you have a 2% inflation target without a specific guideline to achieve it, that won't be as effective.\\\" \\n  The dollar fell to Y88.70, down 1% from Y89.60 late Monday. The euro also dropped 1.1% against the yen to Y118.19 from Y119.50. \\n  The yen's strength Tuesday is a small reversal of the its sharp decline over the past three months. Investors have been betting aggressively against the Japanese currency on expectations for more aggressive BOJ easing to boost the lagging Japanese economy. \\n  Analysts say the next big yen mover will be the announcement of the next BOJ head. Current BOJ head Masaaki Shirakawa officially steps down in April, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could float the names of possible successors well before April. \\n  Accelerating the dollar's declines Tuesday, U.S. housing data came in below expectations. Existing-home sales in December fell 1% to a rate of 4.94 million, falling short of economists' expectations for a 2% rise to 5.14 million. However, on an annual basis, existing-home sales still jumped to their highest level in five years. \\n  Poor regional manufacturing data also raised concerns as manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region turned negative in January, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said. The Richmond Fed's manufacturing index fell to -12 from 5 in December, with readings below zero indicating contracting activity. \\n  Elsewhere, the U.K. pound erased earlier gains after Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King said a weaker pound is needed for economic rebalancing, adding that the BOE is ready to provide more stimulus if necessary. The U.K. pound last traded at $1.5839 from $1.5832 late Monday. \\n  The euro edged up to $1.3322 from $1.3313. \\n  The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, fell to 70.721 from 70.967. \\n  Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 17:04 ET (22:04 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539063,\"Headline\":\"Yen Strengthens After Bank of Japan Policy Change\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358892240000)\\/\"}}"

In emerging economies, traders are keeping a close eye on South Africa, India and Poland, which could cut rates in reaction to measures adopted by other central banks. \\n  Tuesday, the Bank of Japan unveiled a new asset-purchase program that disappointed market participants, leading to a selloff in Asian stocks. \\n  Turkey's central bank continued to ease monetary policy by lowering its overnight borrowing rate to 4.75% from 5%, and its overnight lending rate to 8.75% from 9%, while holding its one-week benchmark interest rate steady at 5.5%. The central bank's hope is to restrict recent currency gains and limit speculative flows into the currency. \\n  \\\"This may alleviate some of the concerns about European growth, but we need to see hard economic data show improvement not just sentiment,\\\" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. \\n  The recent rally of the lira, which hit a 10-month high against the dollar last week, prompted exporters to call for the central bank to intervene and support exports, which have been the biggest factor in Turkey's economic rebalancing. \\n  The dollar rallied on the Tuesday decision, trading at TRY1.7693, up 0.28% on the day, according to CQG data. The lira is expected to remain rangebound in coming months, according to Brown Brothers Harriman analysts. \\n  Currencies in emerging Europe took Turkey's lead and weakened despite better-than-expected business-sentiment data from Germany. Among them, the Hungarian forint was down nearly 0.4% on the day to the euro, at HUF294. \\n  Meanwhile, other emerging-market currencies were buoyed by a revival of support for a potential bill to extend the U.S. borrowing authority until May. \\n  The Mexican peso gained 0.38% to trade at MXN12.6594 to the dollar. \\n  \\\"Currencies with closer trading relationships with the U.S. are benefiting from the U.S. recovery and better outlook,\\\" Ms. Harajli said. \\n  In India, an import tax on gold pushed the rupee to a three-month high against the U.S. dollar. But month-end demand for the dollar from oil importers erased the strength of the move. The rupee recently was trading at INR53.72 to the dollar, from INR53.38 earlier in the day. \\n  Emerging-market debt issuance opened to a busy week. \\n  Peru's BBVA Banco Continental (CONTINC1.VL) is in the market with a $300 million, 3.5-year term deal, while South Korea's Shinhan Bank sold $350 million of 5.5-year notes at a yield of 2.030%. Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVNDA.BO), Colombia's third-largest bank by assets, is raising $500 million in five-year bonds priced at around 225 basis points over comparable Treasury yields. The bank's pricing has firmed up by more than 50 basis points since its launch, and comes on the same day the sovereign looks to sell $1 billion of 10-year bonds. \\n  Some of these deals haven't priced yet. \\n  Write to Prabha Natarajan at prabha.natarajan@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 16:50 ET (21:50 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539054,\"Headline\":\"Turkish Lira Retreats; Other Emerging European Currencies Follow\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358891400000)\\/\"}}"

That is double or triple the volume seen in recent weeks. \\n  Economist Gustavo Ber, who publishes a daily market commentary, said in an interview that it wasn't clear why there was so much interest in Telecom Argentina or YPF. \\n  Mr. Ber said it appeared that some bigger investors had decided to jump into the market and take advantage of what many analyst say are excessively cheap stock prices. \\n  \\\"Stocks have been undervalued for a while now as an investment,\\\" Mr. Ber said. But he noted that because volumes are low in general, relatively minor investments can lead to significant stock movements. \\n  Mr. Ber also said that given changes in the value of Argentina's black-market exchange rate, more investors may be moving into stocks as a way of hedging against currency depreciation. \\n  Additionally, volume may have been higher because the market was returning from a U.S. holiday on Monday. \\n  The power company Pampa Energia SA (PAMP.BA, PAM) led the gains, rising 6.7% to ARS1.27. It was followed by Telecom Argentina, which rose 4.7% to ARS21.25. \\n  YPF led the declines, falling 2.6% to ARS113.45. \\n  Securities tied to economic growth, otherwise known as GDP warrants, were mixed or little changed. \\n  TVPE rose 0.9% to ARS54.90; TVPY fell 0.3% to ARS46.60; and TVYO rose 0.2% to ARS46.10. \\n  The gap between black market exchange rate and the official peso rate remained notable even as the black-market rate strengthened a tad to ARS7.4 to the U.S. dollar. \\n  The official exchange rate, which is closely controlled by the central bank, was unchanged at ARS4.9575 to the dollar on the MAE wholesale currency market. \\n  Write to Taos Turner at taos.turner@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 16:42 ET (21:42 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539050,\"Headline\":\"Argentina's Stock Market Closes Higher as Volume Jumps\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358890920000)\\/\"}}"

The treasury manages Brazil's national debt, including bond issuance, and is subordinated to the Finance Ministry. \\n  Last year, Brazil tapped billions of Brazilian reais from its sovereign wealth fund and also brought forward dividends from the country's national development bank, or BNDES, to be able to meet its primary budget surplus target--the total amount of government savings before payments on the national debt. \\n  Budget surpluses have been central to the improvement of Brazil's economy over the last 15 years and helped reduce the country's net debt burden to just 35% of gross domestic product. Mr. Augustin said that, as a result of that improvement, the government has earned the ability to adjust its spending to match circumstances. \\n  Many economists criticized the move at the end of the 2012, saying the government engaged in financial gymnastics to disguise lower-than-promised savings. \\n  Mr. Augustin rejected that criticism, saying the government has built in a degree of flexibility to get around the rigid framework laid down in the annual budget law approved by Congress. All the government did was deploy additional savings over and above the target, he said. \\n  In 2013, local governments are likely to be allowed to spend more, as part of the federal government's commitment to lift investments, Mr. Augustin said. He added that no final decisions on this have been made and likely won't be until later this month or in early February. \\n  Even with possible adjustments, the current target of a primary budget surplus of 3.1% of GDP won't be altered, Mr. Augustin noted. \\n  The Treasury is comfortable with prospects for government accounts in 2013, as an economic recovery is already on the way, Mr. Augustin said. \\\"I think the Brazilian economy is already rolling at 4%, and I don't see any reason the economy cannot grow 4% this year,\\\" Mr. Augustin said. \\n  He also noted that Brazil's central government surplus for the month of December, which will be announced soon, was very good and even \\\"exceptional.\\\" In November, Brazil's 12-month primary, or operating, budget surplus narrowed to 84.6 billion Brazilian reais ($41.4 billion), or about 1.93% of GDP, helping drive the country further from the alread-reduced year-end target of BRL114.2 billion. \\n  In 2012, Brazil's government announced tax cuts worth BRL45 billion, Mr. Augustin said. For 2013, the government is expecting congress to approve up to BRL40 billion in tax cuts, mainly affecting payrolls, he added. \\n  Mr. Augustin also said the government will likely sell bonds overseas in the coming weeks. \\n  \\\"Maybe it will happen in January or the beginning of February,\\\" Mr. Augustin said, adding the bonds will likely be denominated in U.S. dollars with a 10-year maturity. \\n  Brazil's government last offered overseas debt in September 2012, selling $1.35 billion in 10-year bonds at a yield of 2.686%. That yield was the lowest ever obtained by the country for an overseas bond sale. \\n  Brazil had considered an issuance in December, but decided to postponed plans, due to a slight worsening of international conditions, he said. \\n  The Treasury chief also said Brazil will benefit from the weakening of the real over the past year. \\\"Initially, a shift in the currency can be contractionary because it raises imports a little bit and exports only go up some time after,\\\" Mr. Augustin said. \\\"But after the correction is made, Brazil can sell for the new price and gain with that.\\\" \\n  Write to Luciana Magalhaes at luciana.magalhaes@dowjones.com and Matthew Cowley at matthew.cowley@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 16:21 ET (21:21 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539038,\"Headline\":\"Brazil No Longer Pursuing Strict Spending Goals -Treasury Secretary\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358889660000)\\/\"}}"

(VZ) reported a fourth-quarter loss Tuesday, as year-end charges and smartphone subsidies weighed down results that included the best-ever customer additions to its wireless service. \\n  The Basking Ridge, N.J., telecommunications company reported a $4.23 billion loss that stemmed largely from massive charges from its pension plan, debt-related costs and storm damage. Revenue rose 5.7%. \\n  The addition of new wireless customers generally hurts profits in the short term because many people buy a phone that is subsidized by the carrier. But that gain also widens the base for future revenue growth as smartphone customers are funneled into Verizon's shared-data plans, launched last summer, that better capitalize on customers' increasing data usage and encourages the addition of more devices. \\n  Verizon added a highest-ever 2.1 million in new wireless-contract customers in the quarter, even as overall industry growth has been slow, driven by holiday spending and strong sales of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone. \\n  \\\"I think we gained some share back that we had lost a couple of years ago when we didn't have the iPhone,\\\" Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview, referring to AT&T Inc.'s (T) prior exclusivity with the popular device. \\n  As expected, margins on wireless services dropped in the quarter as subsidies paid on all of those smartphones were a direct hit to profit. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture that is 45% owned by Vodafone Group PLC (VOD, VOD.LN, VODPF). \\n  \\\"We knew margins were going to be light, but they were a little lighter than expected,\\\" said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research, who noted the strong customer trends across Verizon in the quarter. \\n  \\\"What we learned today was that it cost them a little bit more on the expense line than we thought,\\\" he said. \\n  Verizon shares recently rose 16 cents to $42.70. \\n  The company didn't provide specific guidance for 2013. Mr. Shammo projected revenue growth and said he is \\\"more confident in the fundamentals of this business today than I actually was a year ago,\\\" noting earnings growth of about 15% for the first nine months of 2012. \\n  He also said wireless margins in 2013 would be 49% to 50%, a jump from the 46.6% it reported for 2012. \\n  Planned cost cuts this year of $2 billion will contribute to that projected increase in profitability, although he stressed there would be no job cuts related to the savings. The wireless operation cut $5 billion in expenses in the past three years. Capital spending across Verizon will be flat with 2012, he said. \\n  Mr. Shammo also said the company could immediately repurchase shares, an acceleration of the company's previous statements that it could make such a move later this year. \\n  \\\"If the opportunity presents itself in our share price, then I would contemplate buying back shares,\\\" he said, noting the company has clearance to buy up to 100 million shares. \\n  Verizon reported a loss of $4.23 billion, or $1.48 a share, compared with a loss of $2.02 billion, or 71 cents, a year earlier. The most-recent quarter included a charge of $1.86 a share, while the year-earlier quarter included a per-share charge of $1.23 primarily related to the valuation of pension plans. \\n  Excluding items, adjusted per-share earnings were 38 cents, below Wall Street analyst expectations of 50 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Superstorm Sandy, which caused extensive damage to Verizon operations in the Northeast, also reduced adjusted earnings by seven cents a share. \\n  Revenue rose to $30.05 billion, beating expectations of $29.83 billion. \\n  Wireless margins were 41.4%, down from 50% in the third quarter and 42.2% in the year-earlier quarter. Sales of many smartphones include a subsidy, usually of a few hundred dollars, the carriers pay the handset makers to lower the phone's price tag for consumers but also to lock in the buyers as a wireless subscriber for two years. \\n  In the quarter, 9% of customers upgraded their phones. That is a jump from 7% in the previous quarter and less than 10% in the year-earlier quarter. \\n  That upgrade rate would likely be unchanged in 2013, but Mr. Shammo said it is \\\"too early to tell\\\" if Verizon would institute some measures to discourage customers from upgrading their phones. \\n  Mr. Shammo said smartphone subsidies would likely fall over time, but not because of any specific action from Verizon. \\n  Verizon Wireless activated 9.8 million smartphones in the quarter, making up 87% of its total phone sales. Smartphones now account for more than 58% of the Verizon Wireless contract customer base, up from 53% at the end of the previous quarter. \\n  The wireless division--bringing in two-thirds of total revenue--has been leading rivals in both adding customers and reporting low customer cancellations. For 2012, the wireless company added more than five million net new contract customers, bringing its total to 92.5 million. Those additions likely widened its lead over rival AT&T, which will report its results Thursday, and had about 70 million contract customers at the end of September. \\n  Wireless revenue rose 9.5% to $20 billion in the quarter. Total churn, or customers who cancel services, was 0.95%, compared with 0.94% a year earlier and 0.91% in the prior quarter. \\n  Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 15:58 ET (20:58 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539030,\"Headline\":\"3rd UPDATE: Verizon Hit by Charges, Smartphone Subsidies\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358888280000)\\/\"}}"

Brazil needs the  investment rate to rise to 19% of GDP to grow 3% in 2012, and increase to 22% of GDP to meet the government's long-term goal of sustainable growth between 4% and 4.5%. \\n  Brazilian businesses reined in investments during 2012 as the European debt crisis and concerns about a global economic slowdown created economic uncertainties, despite strong domestic demand fueled by low unemployment and growing wages. \\n  Efforts to beef up Brazil's infrastructure ahead of the 2014 World Soccer Cup and 2016 Olympic Games are driving the increased demand for BNDES lending, which rose 12% from 2011 to 156 billion Brazilian reais ($76.3 billion) last year, Mr. Coutinho said. Brazil plans to auction off new concessions to operate airports, highways, ports and railroads that will require heavy investments by winning bidders--and could pave the way for private-sector involvement. \\n  \\\"One of the strongest factors in the acceleration of investments is the introduction of the new concessions,\\\" Mr. Coutinho said. \\\"[The concessions] represent an opportunity to share the financing of these investments with capital markets.\\\" Infrastructure bonds and other financing mechanisms will be tested in 2013 to see whether they are viable means to finance such projects, Mr. Coutinho said. \\n  Marcio Guedes, a director of the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Institutions, or Anbima, recently said that he was \\\"optimistic\\\" about the potential market for infrastructure debentures, but that it was hard to say when such a market could take off. While Brazilian capital markets were capable of absorbing the enormous capital demands of companies selling infrastructure debentures, the lack of a secondary market for such issues was a drawback. \\n  Bringing in the private-sector to help finance Brazil's infrastructure needs would be a welcome development, and could help boost investments going forward, said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco J. Safra. \\\"It's obvious that there is a limit to the amount of long-term resources the BNDES can supply,\\\" Mr. Kawall said, noting that capital injections from Brazil's treasury raise the country's gross debt. \\\"It seems clear that capital markets have to enter in a strong role to support investment growth.\\\" \\n  While Brazil's private-sector banks are strong enough to handle the task, it's a role that they haven't played. Brazil's historically high interest rates typically meant that banks stuck to loaning money to the government, relegating cash to the relative safety of government bonds that returned 10% to 12% per year. With Brazil's benchmark Selic interest rate now at a record low 7.25%, banks are seeking out alternatives. \\n  \\\"During 2012, we had a revolution in monetary policy,\\\" Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Gradual Investimentos, said of last year's rate-cutting cycle. \\\"Now, private-sector banks have the right incentive to make bigger and better loans.\\\" \\n  -Rogerio Jelmayer in Sao Paulo contributed to this article. \\n  Write to Jeff Fick at jeff.fick@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 15:53 ET (20:53 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539029,\"Headline\":\"Brazil's BNDES: Loan Applications Signal Investment Rebound\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358887980000)\\/\"}}"

              "text": "{\"NewsDetail\":{\"Story\":\"\\n  LONDON--The U.K.'s economic recovery has been delayed, not derailed, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Tuesday in a wide ranging speech that argued against a radical overhaul of the central bank's monetary policy framework. \\n  During a visit to Belfast ahead of his retirement from the central bank in June, Mr. King acknowledged that the U.K.'s recovery from the financial crisis that began in late 2008 has been weaker than most other developed economies. \\n  But he said that wasn't the fault of the central bank's actions or the framework within which it has operated, instead pointing to a decline in the real spending power of households as oil and food prices surged, weak lending by a crippled banking sector, and the impact of the euro-zone's crisis on British exports and business confidence. \\n  In recent months the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have made significant changes to the way they conduct monetary policy. Mr. King noted that the BOE's inflation targeting framework has been little altered for 21 years. \\n  \\\"It would be sensible to review the arrangements for setting monetary policy,\\\" he said. \\n  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, who will take over from Mr. King in July, has suggested that the BOE could change its framework. \\n  In a December speech delivered shortly after he was named as the next BOE governor, Mr. Carney said central banks faced with problems similar to those that confront the U.K. may need to make a public commitment to keeping interest rates low or other forms of stimulus in place until the unemployment rate had fallen to a certain level, or some other target had been reached. \\n  For Mr. Carney, who pledged in April 2009 to keep Canada's interest rates low and steady for at least a year, issuing such guidance provides certainty on borrowing costs for businesses and households wondering whether to spend and invest. \\n  Mr. King said the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee has a \\\"flexible\\\" inflation target, since it can choose to delay the return of the inflation rate to its 2.0% target in order to support economic growth. But he noted the BOE's current remit doesn't specify how it should strike a balance between growth and inflation. \\n  \\\"Is there any gain from trying to quantify how the MPC should manage the trade-off between growth and inflation in the short run?\\\" he asked, noting that the Federal Reserve's December pledge to keep interest rates near zero until the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.5% was one way of doing that. \\n  \\\"There are certainly aspects of the inflation targeting regime to consider,\\\" he said. \\n  However, Mr. King appears to be adamantly opposed to a more radical change to the framework that Mr. Carney said could be employed under \\\"exceptional\\\" circumstances--abandoning the inflation target altogether, and instead aiming to boost nominal gross domestic product. \\n  Mr. King said that would risk a return to the high inflation 1970s, which followed the pursuit in the 1960s of \\\"an unrealistic growth rate.\\\" \\n  \\\"The battle to bring inflation expectations down was long and hard,\\\" he said. \\\"A long-run target of 2% inflation should be an essential part of our macroeconomic framework. It would be irresponsible to lose that.\\\" \\n  Mr. King, who was one of the key figures in establishing the inflation targeting regime in the early 1990s, said its continued use by the BOE had not impeded the U.K.'s economic recovery. \\n  \\\"The challenge we face is not the inadequacy of the framework, but the fact that there is no easy route to recovery from a major banking crisis,\\\" he said. \\n  The Office for National Statistics will Friday publish its estimate for GDP in the final three months of last year, and most economists expect that to record a slight contraction. \\n  \\\"Whether negative or positive, growth in Q4 (the fourth quarter) will almost certainly turn out to have been considerably weaker than in Q3,\\\" Mr. King said. \\n  The economy grew in the third quarter after nine straight months of contraction, and has barely expanded since the middle of 2010. \\n  Mr. King said that while the U.K.'s downturn in the wake of the financial crisis was on a par with that of other large developed economies, \\\"our recovery has been noticeably slower.\\\" \\n  But he added that the recovery will have been \\\"delayed\\\" not \\\"derailed\\\" if the U.K. can repair its banks and ensure they can once again lend at low interest rates, while pursuing \\\"structural reforms\\\" that he said it was up to the government to identify. \\n  Mr. King appeared to hold out little hope that the root causes of the other main drag on the recovery--the euro zone's crisis--will be resolved soon. \\n  \\\"The longer term prospects for tackling the evident fault lines in the monetary union (are) uncertain,\\\" he said. \\n  Mr. King said he expects the inflation rate to remain above the BOE's target \\\"for much of this year,\\\" largely as a result of rise in what he called \\\"administered prices,\\\" such as university fees that have been hiked in order to allow for a reduction in government subsidy as part of its austerity program. \\n  Those rises will add one percentage point to the inflation rate, Mr. King said. But he added that the MPC continued to stand ready to provide more stimulus through its purchase of government bonds using new money if that were needed. \\n  \\\"The Monetary Policy Committee can respond flexibly by looking through the effects of administered prices as long as market-generated inflation pressures remain subdued,\\\" he said. \\n  Mr. King repeated his warning about a wave of competitive depreciations of currencies this year, but also hinted that he would like to see sterling weaken. Mr. King noted that sterling depreciated by 25% between late 2007 and the start of 2009, and said a move on that scale \\\"was...necessary for a full rebalancing of our economy.\\\" \\n  However, on a trade-weighted basis, the British pound is now 11% stronger than it was in January 2009. \\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 15:25 ET (20:25 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539020,\"Headline\":\"BOE's King Rejects Abandoning Inflation Target\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358886300000)\\/\"}}"

Volume was moderate at 6.28 billion Brazilian reais ($3.1 billion). \\n  European stocks fell Tuesday on continued worries about global growth, a regional debt crisis and U.S. fiscal woes. The European losses came despite a rise in the ZEW index of investor sentiment in Germany, which rose to 31.5 points from 6.9 in December. The index reached its highest point since May of 2010. \\n  But the German index was not enough to allay European worries about the U.S. economic recovery. The U.S. still faces critical fiscal tests in the next few weeks, including the need to raise the national debt ceiling despite severe criticism of fiscal policies by Republicans in the U.S. Congress. \\n  U.S. housing data didn't help the mood. Sales of existing homes in December actually fell 1.0% against November, contrary to analyst expectations of a rise. \\n  Analysts put support for the Ibovespa index at 61,000 points. They said the index will encounter resistance if it rises later in the weak to 62,100 points. \\n  Traders said the Brazilian market mood will likely remain cautious until Thursday, when the Brazilian Central Bank releases minutes from its January monetary policy meeting. \\n  At the meeting, the bank decided to hold its Selic base rate steady at an all-time low of 7.25%. But the bank seemed to issue mixed signals by expressing worries about both growth and inflation. Investors are hoping minutes from the meeting will offer a clearer picture of the central bank's current thinking. \\n  Brazilian blue chips were mixed at the close Tuesday. \\n  State-run oil company Petrobras advanced 0.98% to close at BRL19.58 as global oil prices jumped. \\n  Mining giant Vale also gained, rising 1.12% to close at BRL39.59 on higher international metals prices. \\n  But Brazil's biggest telecommunications company, Oi, was a loser, dropping 6.64% to BRL9.00. The company announced the resignation of CEO Francisco Valim, to be replaced on a temporary basis by Chairman Jose Carneiro da Cunha. Although the company made no direct comment on the reasons for Mr. Valim's resignation, analysts said he was dropped by Oi because of declining profits in 2012. \\n  Banco Santander Brasil was another big loser Tuesday, falling 3.24% to BRL14.94. The bank is the Brazilian unit of Spain's Banco Santander. Shares in the Brazilian unit fell following comments in Brasilia by Santander's international president, Emilio Botin, who said the company is interested in expanding assets in Brazil, not selling them. \\n  A number of utilities, on the other hand, were winners Tuesday. Analysts said heavy rains in recent days in key parts of the country have helped replenish reservoirs, thus diminishing chances for power rationing. \\n  Federal utilities holding company Eletrobras was up 6.2% at BRL13.70. Sao Paulo utility CESP gained 0.91% to close at BRL21.01. \\n  Shares in Carvao da Colombia, or CCX, showed big gains, closing 22.4% higher at BRL3.83. On Monday night, the firms' parent company, the EBX group controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, announced it would buy back the company's shares and take it private. \\n  Write to Tom Murphy at tom.murphy@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 15:05 ET (20:05 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1539012,\"Headline\":\"Brazilian Stocks Close Lower on European Losses, U.S. Data\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358885100000)\\/\"}}"

The February contract expired at settlement Tuesday, and the more heavily traded March contract settled 64 cents higher at $96.68 a barrel. \\n  Brent crude oil on the ICE futures exchange for March delivery traded 68 cents higher at $112.39 a barrel. \\n  Energy and commodities markets often use equities as a proxy for investor expectations about the future of the economy, and with it, demand for raw materials. On Tuesday, oil markets cheered a turnaround in stocks after declines early in the session. \\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently 0.3% higher at 13693, on pace to finish at the highest level since 2007. \\n  \\\"The bottom line is the equities are starting to find some life here in the afternoon,\\\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. \\\"Crude is trading against its highs, and equities are trading against their highs.\\\" \\n  Oil prices have rallied by roughly 8% since the beginning of December on an improving outlook for global oil demand and concerns that the hostage crisis in Algeria could mark a new period of violence in the oil-rich region. \\n  On Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its global oil-demand forecast for 2013 by 900,000 barrels a day, due to stronger demand from China. \\n  Still, analysts and traders are increasingly wary that the rally could quickly lose steam. \\n  \\\"It looks like we're getting close to a peak on oil,\\\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \\\"We're probably ready for a pullback.\\\" \\n  The Bank of Japan said Tuesday it agreed on an \\\"open-ended\\\" plan to fight deflation, adopting an inflation target of 2% and disclosing open-ended asset purchases. Investor response was mixed, however, as the program won't come into effect until 2014. \\n  Without further support from stock markets and a weaker U.S. dollar, the oil market is unlikely to push higher if demand holds at current levels, some analysts said. \\n  \\\"The uptrend across the energy complex that has been developing for some six weeks has largely run its course,\\\" said Jim Ritterbusch, head of trading adviser Ritterbusch & Associates, in a research report. \\n  Front-month February reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled 3.31 cents, or 1.2%, higher at $2.8299 a gallon. February heating oil settled 0.5% higher at $3.0682 a gallon. \\n  More information on settlements and highs and lows for futures on Nymex and ICE platforms can be found by searching for the following headlines: \\n \\n   Nymex Light Crude Oil Close \\n   Nymex Harbor RBOB Gasoline Close \\n   Nymex Heating Oil Close \\n   ICE Brent Crude Oil Close \\n   ICE Gas Oil Close \\n \\n  Write to Jerry A.

              "text": "{\"NewsDetail\":{\"Story\":\"\\n  By Paul Hannon \\n  LONDON--The U.K.'s economic recovery has been delayed, not derailed, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Tuesday in a wide ranging speech that argued against a radical overhaul of the central bank's monetary policy framework. \\n  During a visit to Belfast ahead of his retirement from the central bank in June, Mr. King acknowledged that the U.K.'s recovery from the financial crisis that began in late 2008 has been weaker than most other developed economies. \\n  But he said that wasn't the fault of the central bank's actions or the framework within which it has operated, instead pointing to a decline in the real spending power of households as oil and food prices surged, weak lending by a crippled banking sector, and the impact of the euro-zone's crisis on British exports and business confidence. \\n  In recent months the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have made significant changes to the way they conduct monetary policy. Mr. King noted that the BOE's inflation targeting framework has been little altered for 21 years. \\n  \\\"It would be sensible to review the arrangements for setting monetary policy,\\\" he said. \\n  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, who will take over from Mr. King in July, has suggested that the BOE could change its framework. \\n  In a December speech delivered shortly after he was named as the next BOE governor, Mr. Carney said central banks faced with problems similar to those that confront the U.K. may need to make a public commitment to keeping interest rates low or other forms of stimulus in place until the unemployment rate had fallen to a certain level, or some other target had been reached. \\n  For Mr. Carney, who pledged in April 2009 to keep Canada's interest rates low and steady for at least a year, issuing such guidance provides certainty on borrowing costs for businesses and households wondering whether to spend and invest. \\n  Mr. King said the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee has a \\\"flexible\\\" inflation target, since it can choose to delay the return of the inflation rate to its 2.0% target in order to support economic growth. But he noted the BOE's current remit doesn't specify how it should strike a balance between growth and inflation. \\n  \\\"Is there any gain from trying to quantify how the MPC should manage the trade-off between growth and inflation in the short run?\\\" he asked, noting that the Federal Reserve's December pledge to keep interest rates near zero until the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.5% was one way of doing that. \\n  \\\"There are certainly aspects of the inflation targeting regime to consider,\\\" he said. \\n  However, Mr. King appears to be adamantly opposed to a more radical change to the framework that Mr. Carney said could be employed under \\\"exceptional\\\" circumstances--abandoning the inflation target altogether, and instead aiming to boost nominal gross domestic product. \\n  Mr. King said that would risk a return to the high inflation 1970s, which followed the pursuit in the 1960s of \\\"an unrealistic growth rate.\\\" \\n  \\\"The battle to bring inflation expectations down was long and hard,\\\" he said. \\\"A long-run target of 2% inflation should be an essential part of our macroeconommic framework. It would be irresponsible to lose that.\\\" \\n  Mr. King, who was one of the key figures in establishing the inflation targeting regime in the early 1990s, said its continued use by the BOE had not impeded the U.K.'s economic recovery. \\n  \\\"The challenge we face is not the inadequacy of the framework, but the fact that there is no easy route to recovery from a major banking crisis,\\\" he said. \\n  The Office for National Statistics will Friday publish its estimate for GDP in the final three months of last year, and most economists expect that to record a slight contraction. \\n  \\\"Whether negative or positive, growth in Q4 (the fourth quarter) will almost certainly turn out to have been considerably weaker than in Q3,\\\" Mr. King said. \\n  The economy grew in the third quarter after nine straight months of contraction, and has barely expanded since the middle of 2010. \\n  Mr. King said that while the U.K.'s downturn in the wake of the financial crisis was on a par with that of other large developed economies, \\\"our recovery has been noticeably slower.\\\" \\n  But he added that the recovery will have been \\\"delayed\\\" not \\\"derailed\\\" if the U.K. can repair its banks and ensure they can once again lend at low interest rates, while pursuing \\\"structural reforms\\\" that he said it was up to the government to identify. \\n   Mr. King appeared to hold out little hope that the root causes of the other main drag on the recovery--the euro zone's crisis--will be resolved soon. \\n  \\\"The longer term prospects for tackling the evident fault lines in the monetary union (are) uncertain,\\\" he said. \\n   Mr. King said he expects the inflation rate to remain above the BOE's target \\\"for much of this year,\\\" largely as a result of rise in what he called \\\"administered prices,\\\" such as university fees that have been hiked in order to allow for a reduction in government subsidy as part of its austerity program. \\n   Those rises will add one percentage point to the inflation rate, Mr. King said. But he added that the MPC continued to stand ready to provide more stimulus through its purchase of government bonds using new money if that were needed. \\n  \\\"The Monetary Policy Committee can respond flexibly by looking through the effects of administered prices as long as market-generated inflation pressures remain subdued,\\\" he said. \\n  Mr. King repeated his warning about a wave of competitive depreciations of currencies this year, but also hinted that he would like to see sterling weaken. Mr. King noted that sterling depreciated by 25% between late 2007 and the start of 2009, and said a move on that scale \\\"was...necessary for a full rebalancing of our economy.\\\" \\n  However, on a trade-weighted basis, the British pound is now 11% stronger than it was in January 2009. \\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 14:45 ET (19:45 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538997,\"Headline\":\"BOE's King Rejects Abandonment of Inflation Target\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358883900000)\\/\"}}"

The sol strengthened about 5.4% against the greenback last year, while in 2011 it gained about 4%. \\n  Some private-sector groups have raised concerns the stronger currency is hurting Peruvian businesses and have called on the government to do more to cool its appreciation. \\n  The Central Reserve Bank of Peru has taken measures to slow the appreciation of the local currency, including intervening in the foreign exchange market each day to purchase dollars and raising reserve requirements to slow credit growth. \\n  Last week, the central bank also increased the maximum amount of assets under management that private pension funds, known as AFPs, can invest in international markets to 32% from 30%. The increase is equivalent to an extra $750 million that can be invested outside of Peru. \\n  At a press conference Tuesday the chief investment officers at the four AFPs currently operating agreed the change won't do much to slow the sol's appreciation. \\n  \\\"The tendency for a stronger sol continues,\\\" said Aldo Ferrini, the head of investments at AFP Integra SA. \\n  Jose Roca, the chief investment officer at Prima AFP, said the sol could appreciate another 4% to 5% this year. \\n  \\\"We estimate that the appreciation could be close to what we've seen in the last few years,\\\" Mr. Roca said. \\n  In a report, Scotiabank Peru said the regulatory change's impact on the sol will be less than the last time the central bank increased the ceiling for AFPs to invest abroad. The last increase, which occurred in 2010, was equivalent to 1.3 times the daily volume traded in the foreign exchange market, while the latest hike is equivalent to 0.7 times the daily volume, according to Scotiabank. \\n  \\\"Given the growth in the foreign exchange market, it is likely that there will be in the future new increases in the investment limit abroad,\\\" the bank said. \\n  RBS also said in a report that the regulatory changes are unlikely to \\\"make a difference\\\" in the sol's appreciation. \\\"We do not expect the decision to have any significant impact on the exchange rate because demand for new assets abroad will be gradual and foreign currency exposure from assets abroad is normally hedged back into local currency to eliminate the exchange rate risk,\\\" it said. \\n  RBS said it forecasts the sol to finish 2013 at PEN2.45 per dollar. The sol closed Tuesday at PEN2.554 per dollar. \\n  Write to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 14:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538982,\"Headline\":\"Peru's Sol Appreciation Seen Despite Pension Fund Changes\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358883600000)\\/\"}}"

The sol strengthened about 5.4% against the greenback last year, while in 2011 it gained about 4%. \\n  Some private-sector groups have raised concerns the stronger currency is hurting Peruvian businesses and have called on the government to do more to cool its appreciation. \\n  The Central Reserve Bank of Peru has taken measures to slow the appreciation of the local currency, including intervening in the foreign exchange market each day to purchase dollars and raising reserve requirements to slow credit growth. \\n  Last week, the central bank also increased the maximum amount of assets under management that private pension funds, known as AFPs, can invest in international markets to 32% from 30%. The increase is equivalent to an extra $750 million that can be invested outside of Peru. \\n  At a press conference Tuesday the chief investment officers at the four AFPs currently operating agreed the change won't do much to slow the sol's appreciation. \\n  \\\"The tendency for a stronger sol continues,\\\" said Aldo Ferrini, the head of investments at AFP Integra SA. \\n  Jose Roca, the chief investment officer at Prima AFP, said the sol could appreciate another 4% to 5% this year. \\n  \\\"We estimate that the appreciation could be close to what we've seen in the last few years,\\\" Mr. Roca said. \\n  In a report, Scotiabank Peru said the regulatory change's impact on the sol will be less than the last time the central bank increased the ceiling for AFPs to invest abroad. The last increase, which occurred in 2010, was equivalent to 1.3 times the daily volume traded in the foreign exchange market, while the latest hike is equivalent to 0.7 times the daily volume, according to Scotiabank. \\n  \\\"Given the growth in the foreign exchange market, it is likely that there will be in the future new increases in the investment limit abroad,\\\" the bank said. \\n  RBS also said in a report that the regulatory changes are unlikely to \\\"make a difference\\\" in the sol's appreciation. \\\"We do not expect the decision to have any significant impact on the exchange rate because demand for new assets abroad will be gradual and foreign currency exposure from assets abroad is normally hedged back into local currency to eliminate the exchange rate risk,\\\" it said. \\n  RBS said it forecasts the sol to finish 2013 at PEN2.45 per dollar. The sol closed Tuesday at PEN2.554 per dollar. \\n  Write to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 14:25 ET (19:25 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538972,\"Headline\":\"Peru's Sol Appreciation Seen Despite Pension Fund Changes\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358882700000)\\/\"}}"

All of our measures are designed to achieve this goal,\\\" he assured an audience at the local chamber of commerce's New Year's reception. \\n  \\\"And looking at current and expected inflation rates, there is simply no evidence that could substantiate fears about any deviation from price stability,\\\" he said. The ECB seeks to keep inflation in the euro zone at just below 2% over the medium term. \\n  The ECB's policy of lending banks unlimited quantities of funds at maturities of up to two years and lowering interest rates to a record low have sparked fears of inflation in Germany, a population that is notoriously sensitive to price changes. \\n  Both the German population and the head of the country's central bank, Jens Weidmann, have taken a critical stance against the ECB's commitment to buy bonds of troubled euro-zone countries if these states agree to a reform program, arguing that such a strategy undemocratically redistributes risks from southern euro-zone states to northern states. \\n  Mr. Draghi, however, turned the argument on its head, saying that in fact this commitment from the ECB mitigated risks to the German taxpayer. Such measures lower Germany's claims in the intra-euro-zone Target2 payment system, a rough indicator of imbalances in the financial system, and they \\\"reduce possible risks for German taxpayers.\\\" \\n  The data backup Mr. Draghi's claims. The Bundesbank's Target2 claims against the Eurosystem have fallen by 95 billion euros ($126.4) since its peak in August, before the ECB announced its bond buying plan. \\n  --Geoffrey T.

This could reduce banks' loan growth, leading to a slowdown in the economy while also jeopardizing the health of the financial system, the analysts say. \\n  Currently, Mr. Correa is a favorite to win in the first round of voting on Feb. 17, according to local polls. \\n  Since taking office in 2007, Mr. Correa has tightened controls on private banks, setting interest rates and increasing the services that banks must provide to clients for free. \\n  Last year, the Ecuadorean government took tough measures to control imports and reduce consumption. The measures included prohibitions, quotas and tariffs on imports, which affected banks, particularly their granting of consumer loans. \\n  In May, Ecuador's National Assembly passed a law, proposed by Mr. Correa, to regulate mortgages and car loans. The legislation limits a borrower's liability in case of failure to repay a loan to the maximum amount of the appraisal of the seized property. \\n  The law also prohibits financial institutions from collecting debts on a mortgage that has gone into default by seizing other properties owned by the mortgage holder. \\n  Ecuadorean banks were also forced to divest or liquidate their stakes in insurance and brokerage companies and pension administrators last year. \\n  The central bank increased to 60% from 45% the obligation for private banks to keep their assets and investments in Ecuador. The central bank also ordered private banks to increase their contributions to Ecuador's liquidity fund to 5% from 3%, and then 1% every year to a maximum of 10%. \\n  In addition, Ecuador's Congress approved a bill to increase taxes on the banking sector starting in January in order to finance the so-called human-development bond. \\n  A recent report from Analytica Securities, an investment bank based in Quito, said this law will \\\"at least challenge bankers' ability to grow in the increasingly hostile environment.\\\" \\n  The government has said it expects to raise about $164 million this year from the tax change. This amount is expected to increase to $171 million in 2014 and $183 million in 2015. \\n  Alberto Acosta, an economist with private consulting firm Analisis Semanal, said the government sees private banks as a tool for monetary policy and to define where the economy should go. \\n  \\\"Now the government regulates how many mortgages should be granted by each bank. For the future it is clear that the government's intention is to define where the loans should go, to whom, [and] how much to lend,\\\" Mr. Acosta said Tuesday. \\n  Official data shows that just 6% of last year's earnings came from foreign banks operating in Ecuador, which includes the U.S.-based Citigroup Inc. (C), Dutch-German Procredit Bank (PCB.YY) and Panama's Promerica. \\n  Mr. Acosta said the Ecuadorean financial system is becoming less attractive to foreign investors because it is highly regulated and there are continuous rule changes. \\n  Write to Mercedes Alvaro at mercedes.alvaro@dowjones.com \\n  Order free Annual Report for Citigroup, Inc.\\n  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US1729674242 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 14:12 ET (19:12 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538968,\"Headline\":\"Ecuador's 2012 Banking Sector Profit Down 21% to $312 Million\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358881920000)\\/\"}}"

(GM) could end car production at its Adam Opel unit's Bochum, Germany, auto assembly plant nearly two years earlier than planned, amid a further downturn in the European economy and rising costs. \\n  GM Vice Chairman and Opel Supervisory Board Chairman Stephen Girsky said in a letter to employees that auto production at the Bochum plant may be halted at the beginning of 2015 rather than in late 2016 due to the weak car demand in Europe. However, union representatives are in talks with management to stop the closure. \\n  \\\"It is not only unrealistic, but also illusionary to think that the market is going to recover quickly,\\\" Mr. Girsky said in the letter. \\\"At all German locations...we must find solutions to become more flexible, cut down on bureaucracy and lower costs.\\\" \\n  Mr. Girsky said that's why a solution has to be found by the end of February, given that talks between unions and Opel management had been ongoing since last June. \\n  The early closure threat intensifies the pressure on the already stressed relationship between Opel and its unions. The IG Metall union said it holds Opel responsible for the slow progress in identifying more cost-cutting moves. It also said on Tuesday it won't support a wage freeze proposal offered by the company. \\n  Bochum's assembly line closure would affect more than 3,000 of the 40,000 workers that Opel employs in Europe. Only 400 staff working in logistics would then still remain at Bochum. \\n  \\\"In all my long career, I've never seen negations that were so poorly managed and prepared as the ones Opel management has been offering since last summer,\\\" IG Metall Chairman Berthold Huber said. \\n  GM intends to honor the existing contract regarding the Bochum location, even if the parties couldn't reach an agreement. However, that contract expires at the end of 2014, Mr. Girsky said in the letter. \\n  An Opel spokeswoman said the company still plans to stop producing complete cars in the German town at the end of 2016. However, it is not impossible that production could be halted earlier than that, she added, as discussions continue. \\n  Opel doesn't expect demand will notably pick up before 2015 or 2016. Consumer buying, the company said, isn't expected to reach the precrisis level of 2007 for at least 15 years. \\n  Write to Nico Schmidt at Nico.Schmidt@dowjones.com and Ilka Kopplin at Ilka.Kopplin@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 13:50 ET (18:50 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538955,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: GM in Talks on Early Closing of Opel Plant in Bochum\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358880600000)\\/\"}}"

She added that the regulation of the banking sector can be effective only if international comprehensive regulation finally were to include nonbanking financial institutions, or shadow banks. \\n  A panel headed by Bank of Finland Governor and European Central Bank policy maker Erkki Liikanen in October concluded that a split of retail and certain investment-banking activities would transform banks into simpler institutions that are easier to supervise. \\n  The European Commission is considering whether to draft legislation that would give the recommendations of the Liikanen report legal force. The consultation phase runs to the end of May. \\n  Ms. Koenig also said she doubts whether a sustained overhaul of calculating benchmark interbank rates such as the London interbank offered rate or euro interbank offered rate, is possible. She noted that the rates, which have been calculated based on market participants' estimates, are vulnerable to manipulation and that there are often periods during which there aren't real transactions on which to base the calculation. \\n  \\\"In my view, we need not only work on a general reform of the system but also on a replacement,\\\" Ms. Koenig said. \\n  The benchmark rates, which serve as the basis for trillions of euros of loans and other financial contracts, have been tarnished by banks' attempts to manipulate them and by the recent decision by a handful of banks to stop being involved in setting the rate. \\n   Under Europe's planned single banking supervisor, the European Central Bank will likely supervise around 30 German banks and 130 to 150 European banks from March 1, 2014, onward, Ms. Koenig said. The ECB can fulfill that task only in close cooperation with national supervisors, Ms. Koenig said. \\n  To prevent risks, BaFin is examining whether insurers, which fared better than banks in the financial crisis, should also be required to come up with restructuring plans, like banks, and what the minimum requirements for such plans could be, Ms. Koenig said. \\n  As of now, it is \\\"realistic\\\" to assume that Europe's planned capital and risk-management regime for insurers, known as Solvency II, will start Jan. 1, 2017, rather than the currently discussed early 2016 starting date for full implementation, Ms. Koenig said. \\n  Write to Ulrike Dauer at ulrike.dauer@wsj.com \\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 13:50 ET (18:50 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538953,\"Headline\":\"BaFin Pres: Europe's Proposed Investment Bank Ring-Fencing Has Limits\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358880600000)\\/\"}}"

All of our measures are designed to achieve this goal,\\\" he assured an audience at the local chamber of commerce's New Year's reception. \\n  \\\"And looking at current and expected inflation rates, there is simply no evidence that could substantiate fears about any deviation from price stability,\\\" he said. The ECB seeks to keep inflation in the euro zone at just below 2% over the medium term. \\n  The ECB's policy of lending banks unlimited quantities of funds at maturities of up to two years and lowering interest rates to a record low have sparked fears of inflation in Germany, a population that is notoriously sensitive to price changes. \\n  Both the German population and the head of the country's central bank, Jens Weidmann, have taken a critical stance against the ECB's commitment to buy bonds of troubled euro-zone countries if these states agree to a reform program, arguing that such a strategy undemocratically redistributes risks from southern euro-zone states to northern states. \\n  Mr. Draghi, however, turned the argument on its head, saying that in fact this commitment from the ECB mitigated risks to the German taxpayer. Such measures lower Germany's claims in the intra-euro-zone Target2 payment system, a rough indicator of imbalances in the financial system, and they \\\"reduce possible risks for German taxpayers.\\\" \\n  The data backup Mr. Draghi's claims. The Bundesbank's Target2 claims against the Eurosystem have fallen by 95 billion euros ($126.4) since its peak in August, before the ECB announced its bond buying plan. \\n  --Geoffrey T.

The proposal to separate risky businesses, such as investment banking, from the more stable business of maintaining savings deposits is meant to be Europe's response to the financial crisis. \\n  \\\"We are going to make an effort to implement these kinds of measures in Europe and at the national level with the aim of limiting the risks associated with speculative activity, ensuring financial stability, and the efficient financing of industry,\\\" the governments of Germany and France said in a joint statement. \\n  Chancellor Angela Merkel may be getting behind the Liikanen plan because it could help her in the upcoming election campaign, analysts said. The main opposition Social Democrats grabbed headlines last year with a plan of their own that called for forcing German banks such as Deutsche Bank (DB, DBK.XE), the country's largest bank, to create an internal separation between its investment banking and retail banking. Supporting the Liikanen plan would allow Ms. Merkel to back the regulation without appearing to steal the idea from the SPD and still rob the opposition of a campaign issue. \\n  If implemented, the Liikanen proposals would fall short of actually separating investment banks from retail banks, as in the U.S. Banks still would be allowed to operate both investment banking and retail banking, but the businesses would be legally separated within the financial institution, erecting a legal firewall so that toxic assets from one business couldn't infect another part of the bank's operations. \\n  Write to William Boston at william.boston@dowjones.com, Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Ulrike Dauer ulrike.dauer@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 13:42 ET (18:42 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538949,\"Headline\":\"Germany, France Back Liikanen Bank Regulation Plan\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358880120000)\\/\"}}"

The companies spent $10 billion to expand the Port Arthur refinery to 600,000 barrels a day, making it the largest refinery in the U.S. \\n  A person familiar with the refinery's operations said Tuesday that the expansion segment will run at 200,000 to 225,000 barrels per day for about three to four weeks before ramping up to its full capacity of 325,000 barrels. \\n  But the new crude unit has experienced several problems since it first debuted last spring. The unit underwent six months of repairs when caustic--a chemical that neutralizes the acid in heavy, sour crudes but can also corrode steel--leaked into the unit and caused extensive corrosion throughout its pipes. \\n  The crude distillation unit is the first step in the oil refining process, separating oil into different cuts that form the basis of different fuels. \\n  The process of restarting the unit began late last year, but was further delayed by the discovery of new pipe leaks and a small fire. \\n  Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 22, 2013 13:35 ET (18:35 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1538944,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: Motiva Restarts Expansion Segment Of Port Arthur Refinery\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1358879700000)\\/\"}}"
