But \\\"most of the work remains to be done,\\\" he said in a CNBC television interview. \\n  \\\"We should be cutting the deficit slowly, steadily...every year for a while,\\\" through higher revenue and lower budgets, Mr. Blanchard said. Cutting the deficit at a rate of 1% to 1.5% of GDP a year would still allow the economy to expand, he said. Moving faster would \\\"kill growth,\\\" he added. \\n  The top fund economist said a credible deficit-cutting program would also spur the economy by dispelling uncertainty that is holding private-sector investment back. \\n  \\\"If you could clarify this, I suspect uncertainty would disappear, and then private economy would actually do quite well,\\\" Mr. Blanchard said. \\n  Rating companies have warned the U.S. risks further cuts to its credit status, moves the IMF cautions could cause a sudden jump in borrowing costs for the country and erode the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency. \\n   The IMF counselor said while 2012 represented a \\\"sea change\\\" in Europe's response to its debt crisis, and as euro markets appear to be sanguine, the fund is concerned about the lack of growth. \\n  \\\"What's worrisome is the real economy, which is what we really care about, is doing poorly,\\\" he said. \\n   Still, Mr. Blanchard said he didn't expect any major adjustments in the IMF's global economic outlook for the year. \\n  Write to Ian Talley at Ian.talley@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 18:13 ET (23:13 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529984,\"Headline\":\"IMF's Top Economist: U.S. Should Cut Deficit By 1% to 1.5% of GDP -CNBC\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357341180000)\\/\"}}"

Derby \\n \\n  SAN DIEGO--Blurring the lines between central bank and fiscal actions is compromising the ability of central banks to act effectively, as can now be seen with the European Central Bank, a key Federal Reserve official said Friday. \\n  \\\"Financial crisis aftershocks have introduced a 'creeping politicization' of central banking globally,\\\" warned Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard. This can compromise the independence of central banks, and \\\"to the extent that central bank independence is weakened globally, macroeconomic stabilization policy will not be executed as well in the future as it has been since the mid-1980s,\\\" he said. \\n  The policy maker said central banks have found themselves in this challenging place because the financial crisis has required an extraordinary response, leading central banks to take unprecedented actions. \\n  This can be seen most clearly in Europe. Mr. Bullard zeroed in on the ECB's recently launched outright monetary transactions as a problematic development. The program sees the ECB buy the bonds of nations that agree to follow programs to get their respective economies back on track. \\n  \\\"One interpretation\\\" of the ECB's bond buying program \\\"is that it is a fiscal-type operation, and that ordinary monetary policy has become part of the negotiation over the fiscal package,\\\" Mr. Bullard said. \\n  The program has caused the ECB to lose track of its fundamental goals, the official said. \\n  \\\"One could argue that the monetary policy response to the European recession has been muted compared to more ordinary circumstances,\\\" Mr. Bullard said. \\n  \\\"Why? By nearly all accounts, the monetary policy process has been bogged down by political wrangling over the [bond buying effort] and other programs,\\\" he said. \\n  Mr. Bullard will rotate into a voting slot on the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. The materials prepared in advance for his remarks before the American Economic Association in San Diego didn't contain any forward-looking comments on the monetary policy or economic outlook. \\n  He has long worried about issues of central bank independence, and has fretted before about central bankers taking on responsibilities that more appropriately reside with elected leaders. \\n  The official proposed a unique solution to the problem that often arises with fiscal policy actions, which are often slow and difficult to assemble. \\n  \\\"Democratically elected institutions could certainly create a fiscal stabilization authority, perhaps modeled on the FOMC, that could make technocratic fiscal decisions in speedy reaction to macroeconomic events,\\\" Mr. Bullard said. \\\"Such an authority could be allowed to act within assigned limits and under a clearly specified mandate with periodic reporting,\\\" he said. \\n \\n   Write to Michael S.

Total open short euro positions have fallen just 5% over the past month, compared with a 70% jump in total open long euro positions in the same period. \\n  The new pro-euro bets have come as concerns about an imminent debt crisis in the euro zone's most fiscally vulnerable countries faded, in part thanks to a debt buyback plan in Greece that met the target set by its creditors in early December. \\n  Meanwhile, investors pared back bets that the yen would drop against the dollar. The net yen short position fell to $11.6 billion, down 8% from the previous week. \\n  While the reduction in yen shorts could be the result of investors taking profits on existing antiyen positions, speculators are still betting heavily for the yen to decline. Expectations are high for aggressive monetary easing from the Bank of Japan after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party were officially sworn into office last week. Mr. Abe has advocated radical measures to boost Japan's lagging economy and stem the yen's strength, including unlimited money-printing and negative interest rates. \\n  On Friday, the dollar jumped to its strongest level against the yen in 2 1/2 years, trading above 88 yen in the spot trading market for the first time since July 2010. \\n  Overall, investors increased their short dollar positions to $10.8 billion, up 41% from the previous week. \\n  The report tracks the movements of speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

By the same token, they might be more inclined to stock up on greenbacks when their mood improves. \\n  For the past four years, trading patterns have often been ruled by what's known as the risk-on/risk-off paradigm. Traders tended to respond to moments of market uncertainty by piling into the dollar, whose high liquidity makes it an ideal safe haven, while selling currencies perceived as risky. They would do the opposite whenever signs of improved economic and financial stability have emerged. \\n  Going forward, that choice may not be so clear-cut. And much of that stems from the fact that the twin crises that dominated markets for the past four years, the financial crisis of 2008 and the euro-zone debt crisis, are finally showing signs of abating. The extraordinary monetary stimulus actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have succeeded in warding off the risk of financial collapse at the same time that fears of sharp slowdown in China have also subsided. \\n  As anxiety over the threat of a devastating global event fades, players in the currency market can shift back to their precrisis mode of making investment decisions: comparing the interest rate differentials and macroeconomic prospects between various economies. It ceases to be a binary choice between the dollar and so-called risk currencies, and instead requires a nuanced appraisal of each country's outlook for the economy and interest rates. \\n  Markets got a taste of that new paradigm on Friday. When U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell short of expectations, the greenback dipped against the euro, when in the recent past it would often strengthen as the bad news would lower investors' appetite for risk. \\n  \\\"Increasingly, we'll see a dynamic where good U.S. jobs data translates into a less negative impact for the dollar, because it brings the end of stimulus closer,\\\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. \\\"We may have already taken a very small step in that direction.\\\" \\n  The new dynamic is putting more focus on the different outlooks for monetary policy between the U.S. and the euro zone. Before Friday's modest jobs report-inspired pullback in the dollar, the euro had lost almost three cents since New Year's Day, as analysts have come increasingly to see the ECB keeping rates low for a longer period than the Fed's rates, due to the euro zone's especially lackluster economic circumstances. If the differential between the Fed's near-zero rates and the ECB's 0.75% benchmark is seen narrowing in the future, the shift works in favor of the dollar as the comparable returns on U.S. deposits would rise. \\n  In the recent past, such a big decline in the euro would have been less associated with interest rate differentials and more with news that raised the prospect of a break-up in the euro zone. No such fears are present right now. \\n  Rather, the biggest news item behind the currency move was the release Thursday of minutes from the Fed's December meeting, which revealed that some Fed officials were buoyed sufficiently by signs of economic improvement in the U.S. that they foresaw an end to the central bank's aggressive bond purchases before year-end. \\n   \\\"For the last few years, we've been in an environment where global shocks in the U.S. and Europe drove everything,\\\" said Jens Nordvig, chief currency strategist at Nomura in New York. \\\"Now, traders are starting to think more normally about monetary policy and fundamentals.\\\" \\n  Write to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 16:59 ET (21:59 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529964,\"Headline\":\"Bad News Is No Longer Good News for Dollar\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357336740000)\\/\"}}"

Total open short euro positions have fallen just 5% over the past month, compared with a 70% jump in total open long euro positions in the same period. \\n  The new pro-euro bets have come as concerns about an imminent debt crisis in the euro zone's most fiscally vulnerable countries faded, in part thanks to a debt buyback plan in Greece that met the target set by its creditors in early December. \\n  Meanwhile, investors pared back bets that the yen would drop against the dollar. The net yen short position fell to $11.6 billion, down 8% from the previous week. \\n  While the reduction in yen shorts could be the result of investors taking profits on existing antiyen positions, speculators are still betting heavily for the yen to decline. Expectations are high for aggressive monetary easing from the Bank of Japan after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party were officially sworn into office last week. Mr. Abe has advocated radical measures to boost Japan's lagging economy and stem the yen's strength, including unlimited money-printing and negative interest rates. \\n  On Friday, the dollar jumped to its strongest level against the yen in 2 1/2 years, trading above 88 yen in the spot trading market for the first time since July 2010. \\n  Overall, investors increased their short dollar positions to $10.8 billion, up 41% from the previous week. \\n  The report tracks the movements of speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although a small part of the global currency markets, these investors' positions are considered indicators of trading among investors like hedge funds.

Market participants feared a Fed unwind could hurt a previous steady flow of funds into all emerging markets and instead have regions trading much more discriminantly. \\n  \\\"Looking forward, emerging-market assets are more likely to be fundamentally driven and not rely on weaker dollar,\\\" said Conrad Saldanha, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. \\n  Fears about a potential change in thinking at the Fed led to a selloff in the rand and other emerging-market currencies overnight. The rand fell as low as ZAR8.6705, but pared those losses to trade recently at ZAR8.5571 to the dollar, according to CQG data. \\n  The recovery in the rand was a \\\"knee-jerk\\\" reaction, said Guillaume Tresca, senior strategist at Credit Agricole. He expects government bonds of emerging markets to make gains in coming weeks and currencies to weaken. \\n  The Mexican peso showed a similar reaction. The peso gained 0.43% on the day and is once again trading below MXN12.75, according to CQG data. \\n  Even so, not all emerging-market currencies could recover as completely as the rand and peso. Many of the European currencies such as the Hungarian forint and Czech koruna remained under pressure. The forint last traded at HUF290.35 to the euro, from HUF288.72 on Thursday. \\n  In Latin America, a previous run higher in the Colombian peso stalled. The gains had been driven by a new tax law that allowed foreign investors to pay less tax on peso-denominated Colombian debt, but investors have recently found that the central bank is intent on nipping more currency gains in the bud through intervention. \\n  The peso was 0.5% weaker at COP1771.3 to the dollar. \\n  In Egypt, uncertainty about the country's politics and economy continued to weigh on the currency. The pound weakened to a new low to the dollar at EGP6.4292, according to CQG data. Investors have been selling assets in the country, particularly equity fund managers who liked Egypt last year for its strong performance and signs of a recovery. \\n  Meanwhile, the Brazilian real moved to its own rhythm. The real was 0.7% stronger on the day, despite a decline in November industrial production. Brazil's production numbers were better than market consensus, of a 0.9% decline, driving the U.S. dollar below BRL2.05 for the first time since November. That's just before the dollar rose sharply against the real due to market fears of direct action from the central bank to depreciate the currency. \\n  Also Friday, Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the government may be ready to loosen its grip on rates and currencies. Such a move was just another reason market participants tested how far the central bank might let the real appreciate. For roughly six months, traders had seen BRL2.00 to the dollar as the central bank's floor. \\n  The U.S. dollar last changed hands at BRL2.0341, according to CQG data. \\n  -Dan Molinski contributed to this article \\n  Write to Prabha Natarajan at prabha.natarajan@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 16:33 ET (21:33 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529952,\"Headline\":\"Rand Leads Emerging-Market Currencies in Recovery Rally\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357335180000)\\/\"}}"

Bernard \\n \\n  Traders will turn their focus toward central banker speeches in the coming days, after minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting sent the dollar surging against the euro and yen this week. \\n  The dollar swiftly reacted to the release of the minutes from the Fed's December meeting on Thursday as investors interpreted them as a signal that monetary easing could end sooner than had been priced in the market. That helped the dollar gain on the euro and yen because tighter policy typically supports the greenback. \\n  A string of speeches from central bankers in the coming days will tell the market \\\"what the Fed actually thinks,\\\" said Steven Englander, head of G10 strategy at Citigroup in New York. \\n  Three regional Fed presidents are speaking Thursday: St. Louis President James Bullard, Kansas City President Esther George and Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota. Philadelphia President Charles Plosser speaks Friday. \\n  Mr. Bullard and Ms. George are voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee this year so their comments will be watched especially closely since they have a greater say in dictating policy in 2013. On Friday, Mr. Bullard said in a CNBC interview the labor market isn't healthy enough for the Fed to halt its bond-buying program but could consider it if the unemployment rate falls close to 7%. The unemployment rate in December was 7.8%. \\n  The Fed minutes \\\"didn't necessarily signal a policy shift\\\" but it definitely provided a possible change in trader expectations, said Brian Kim, a strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn. \\n  The minutes of the meeting showed that some members of the Fed believed bond purchases, known as quantitative easing could be completed in 2013. The market has been positioned for easing to end in 2014. \\n  Any further comments that cement the market view on when bond purchases will end would likely be reflected most acutely in dollar-yen, Mr. Kim said. With expectations for the Bank of Japan to continue easing aggressively, any signal that the U.S. plans to tighten would cause the yen to sink, he said. \\n  The dollar traded as high as Y88.48 Friday, its highest level since July 2010, trading late in the session at Y88.19, according to EBS via CQG. \\n  The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar's value against a basket of major currencies, climbed on Friday to its highest level since August 22 at 71.38. It was most recently at 71.08. \\n  \\\"There's nothing that screams drama\\\" during the upcoming week, Citigroup's Mr. Englander said. But \\\"no one expected the last two days to be as dramatic as they were.\\\" \\n  Events in the euro zone could also be a factor in currency markets, traders said. The European Central Bank holds its monthly meeting Thursday. While it is not expected to change policy, President Mario Draghi's post-meeting press conference could provide clues for future actions. Some investors and analysts speculate the ECB could set a negative deposit rate in an effort to spur lending and growth. \\n  Spain and Italy also auction debt late in the coming week. Declining bond yields in those countries has helped steady the euro in recent months and significantly reduced downside risk in the common currency. \\n  -Write to Stephen L.

The latest central bank survey of economists showed expectations of 3.3% growth this year. \\n  Brazilian blue chips traded mostly lower Friday. \\n  Brazilian oil producer OGX shrugged off the broader market decline after it announced production has started from a third well at the Tubarao Azul field.

That said, a new paper by University of California, Berkeley, economists Christina and David Romer said policy makers need to embrace the powerful tools at their disposal, believing that when they don't, the economy pays the price. \\n  The paper will be presented Saturday at the American Economic Association annual gathering in San Diego. The research is titled \\\"The Most Dangerous Idea in Federal Reserve History: Monetary Policy Doesn't Matter.\\\" \\n  For the Romers, central bankers have tended to make mistakes because they saw limits that may not have existed. \\\"An unduly pessimistic view of what monetary policy can accomplish has been a more important source of policy errors and poor outcomes over the history of the Federal Reserve,\\\" they wrote. \\n  The Romers say central bank policies during the Great Depression and during the 1970s turned out badly because of Fed officials' self-doubt. The last few years, as the Romers see it, also show that while a lot was done, it has been done amid worries about its costs and benefits. \\n  The economists argue that during the 1930s Fed official believed monetary policy had \\\"minimal\\\" power to fight back against the sharp drop in activity and surge in unemployment, so they failed to do all they could. During the inflation surge in the mid- to late 1970s, the Fed held back on fighting price pressures, believing the cost would be too great, the paper said. \\n  \\\"There is evidence that in the past few years, faced with high unemployment and a weak recovery, monetary policymakers believed that policy was relatively weak and potentially costly\\\" and once again, they did not act as boldly as they could. \\n  \\\"In each episode, the belief that monetary policy was ineffective led to a marked passivity in policymaking,\\\" the Romers wrote. \\n  The paper's conclusion is unlikely to sit easily with the wide range of critics who remain very uncomfortable with the actions taken by the central bank over the course of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Since 2008, the Fed has been involved in a series of radical actions taken in response to the collapse of the housing market and the ensuing economic tumult. \\n  Whereas for decades the Fed's main influence over the economy came from its control over short-term rates, the central bank slashed short rates to zero, launched massive bond-buying programs and used a slew of emergency lending programs unique in its history. It also engaged in bailouts of failing financial institutions. \\n  Critics worried about the inflationary impact of the Fed's monetary policy efforts, which are continuing as the central bank continues to expand its massive balance sheet. Others, including some key Fed officials, worried the central bank had strayed into actions best left to Congress and the political process. \\n  The Romers acknowledge in their paper that it is true the Fed has acted boldly in recent years. But they note that even supporters of aggressive action have talked frequently about the downsides of their actions, while saying repeatedly monetary policy isn't a cure-all for the economy. \\n  \\\"Faced with persistent high unemployment and below-target inflation, beliefs that the benefits of expansion are small and the costs potentially large appear to have led monetary policymakers to eschew more aggressive expansionary policy in much of 2010 and 2011,\\\" the economists wrote. \\\"In hindsight, these beliefs may be judged too pessimistic.\\\" \\n  Write to Michael S.

Fed December survey found dealers expecting QE into early 2014 \\n  --Dealers torn about effectiveness of Fed's policy communication \\n  --Dealers expected jobless, inflation rates to be policy thresholds, but not adopted so soon \\n  (Updates throughout with survey questions about Fed's policy communication, economic thresholds.) \\n  By Cynthia Lin \\n  NEW YORK--Surveyed ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month, Wall Street's biggest banks expected the central bank to continue its bond buying into early 2014. \\n  In a survey released Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, banks were asked a wide range of questions regarding their outlook on the economy and monetary policy. Responses came from 21 banks, known as primary dealers, that can transact directly with the central bank and underwrite U.S. government bond auctions. \\n  The survey was conducted ahead of the Fed's Dec. 11-12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, at which the central bank launched an extension of its Treasury purchasing efforts to the tune of $45 billion a month. \\n  As shown in the survey, dealers broadly expected the Fed to buy more Treasurys. The median expectation among the group was for the Fed to keep buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities until the first quarter of 2014. \\n  \\\"Several dealers expected the end of the purchase program to coincide with improvements in the labor market, with some dealers assigning specific unemployment rates to their forecasts for the end of asset purchases,\\\" the New York Fed said. \\n  The survey also showed that dealers expected the Fed to keep up its pace of Treasurys purchases at $45 billion each month for another year, before slowing to a monthly rate of $35 billion. \\n  This detail hints at the fact that some dealers were already expecting a slowdown in the Fed's purchasing efforts around the end of 2013. Minutes from the Fed's December meeting released Thursday caused a stir because it showed \\\"several\\\" policy board members thinking it would be appropriate to rein in the program before year's end. \\n  The Fed also queried the effectiveness of its policy communication. Dealers were torn, with a bulk of the responses rating the central bank's communication with the public at neutral to somewhat effective. Using words to relay its intentions for monetary policy has been one of the biggest changes ushered in by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. \\n  Indeed, at the December meeting, the Fed took the unprecedented step of tying its policy rate to economic thresholds. Specifically, the central bank aims to keep the policy rate low if the unemployment rate stands above 6.5%, as long as inflation expectations hold below 2.5%. \\n  The dealers were asked what economic parameters they expected the Fed to use, and they correctly pointedto inflation and unemployment rates, though most didn't expect the Fed to adopt the framework so soon. Dealers pinned a median 10% chance of the Fed announcing the move at the December meeting. \\n  Another unanticipated outcome was how financial markets would react to the new regime. After the thresholds were announced on Dec. 12, Treasury bonds fell, believing the thresholds would lead to sooner-than-expected tightening. \\n  In contrast, \\\"several dealers stated that thresholds would ease financial conditions, with a few mentioning that the threshold levels they expected to be adopted could potentially signal a later lift-off date than that expected by the market,\\\" the New York Fed detailed. \\n  -Write to Cynthia Lin at cynthia.lin@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 15:09 ET (20:09 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529888,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: N.Y.

Fed December survey found dealers expecting QE into early 2014 \\n  --Dealers torn about effectiveness of Fed's policy communication \\n  --Dealers expected jobless, inflation rates to be policy thresholds, but not adopted so soon \\n  (Updates throughout with survey questions about Fed's policy communication, economic thresholds.) \\n  By Cynthia Lin \\n  NEW YORK--Surveyed ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month, Wall Street's biggest banks expected the central bank to continue its bond buying into early 2014. \\n  In a survey released Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, banks were asked a wide range of questions regarding their outlook on the economy and monetary policy. Responses came from 21 banks, known as primary dealers, that can transact directly with the central bank and underwrite U.S. government bond auctions. \\n  The survey was conducted ahead of the Fed's Dec. 11-12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, at which the central bank launched an extension of its Treasury purchasing efforts to the tune of $45 billion a month. \\n  As shown in the survey, dealers broadly expected the Fed to buy more Treasurys. The median expectation among the group was for the Fed to keep buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities until the first quarter of 2014. \\n  \\\"Several dealers expected the end of the purchase program to coincide with improvements in the labor market, with some dealers assigning specific unemployment rates to their forecasts for the end of asset purchases,\\\" the New York Fed said. \\n  The survey also showed that dealers expected the Fed to keep up its pace of Treasurys purchases at $45 billion each month for another year, before slowing to a monthly rate of $35 billion. \\n  This detail hints at the fact that some dealers were already expecting a slowdown in the Fed's purchasing efforts around the end of 2013. Minutes from the Fed's December meeting released Thursday caused a stir because it showed \\\"several\\\" policy board members thinking it would be appropriate to rein in the program before year's end. \\n  The Fed also queried the effectiveness of its policy communication. Dealers were torn, with a bulk of the responses rating the central bank's communication with the public at neutral to somewhat effective. Using words to relay its intentions for monetary policy has been one of the biggest changes ushered in by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. \\n  Indeed, at the December meeting, the Fed took the unprecedented step of tying its policy rate to economic thresholds. Specifically, the central bank aims to keep the policy rate low if the unemployment rate stands above 6.5%, as long as inflation expectations hold below 2.5%. \\n  The dealers were asked what economic parameters they expected the Fed to use, and they correctly pointedto inflation and unemployment rates, though most didn't expect the Fed to adopt the framework so soon. Dealers pinned a median 10% chance of the Fed announcing the move at the December meeting. \\n  Another unanticipated outcome was how financial markets would react to the new regime. After the thresholds were announced on Dec. 12, Treasury bonds fell, believing the thresholds would lead to sooner-than-expected tightening. \\n  In contrast, \\\"several dealers stated that thresholds would ease financial conditions, with a few mentioning that the threshold levels they expected to be adopted could potentially signal a later lift-off date than that expected by the market,\\\" the New York Fed detailed. \\n  -Write to Cynthia Lin at cynthia.lin@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 14:54 ET (19:54 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529884,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: N.Y.

The unemployment rate was 7.8%, the same as the prior month. \\n  While Friday's jobs report was \\\"reasonably good\\\" and consistent with a U.S. economy that's growing at 2% or better, the improvement hasn't been strong enough to alter Fed policy, said Mr. Bullard, who will be a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee 2013. \\n  \\\"I don't think there's been enough improvement since September,\\\" Mr. Bullard said in the interview. \\\"We've only had a few months here.\\\" \\n  But Mr. Bullard said if unemployment fell to 7.1% by the end of 2013, consistent with the average 0.7 percentage point drop in unemployment in the previous three years, that would constitute \\\"substantial improvement\\\" in the U.S. labor market. At that point, \\\"the committee would think about removing accommodation on the balance-sheet side of policy.\\\" \\n  In December, the FOMC said it would keep interest rates low as long as unemployment remained above 6.5%. \\n  If the unemployment rate fell close to 7% in 2013, \\\"then you're within a half a point of 6.5%,\\\" Mr. Bullard said. \\\"Clearly, the intention is to pull back on the balance-sheet policy sometime before you would start thinking about raising the rate.\\\" \\n  The St. Louis Fed chief said the Congressional deal on the so-called \\\"fiscal cliff\\\" doesn't change his outlook on the economy since the Fed had expected a \\\"bare-bones\\\" deal that would lead to more political wrangling in the future. \\n  He added that an upcoming decision from leaders in Washington over the debt ceiling \\\"is a dangerous thing to fight over\\\" and said he hoped for a smoother resolution than the last debt-ceiling impasse in 2011. \\n  Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 14:35 ET (19:35 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529876,\"Headline\":\"Bullard Says Job Market Too Weak to Halt Bond Buying\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357328100000)\\/\"}}"

Responses came from 21 banks, known as primary dealers, that can transact directly with the central bank and underwrite U.S. government bond auctions. \\n  The survey was conducted ahead of the Fed's Dec. 11-12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where the central bank launched an extension of its Treasury purchasing efforts to the tune of $45 billion a month. \\n  As showed in the survey, dealers broadly expected the Fed to buy more Treasurys. The median expectation among the group was for the Fed to keep buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities until the first quarter of 2014. \\n  The survey also showed that dealers expected the Fed to keep up its pace of Treasurys purchases at $45 billion each month for another year, before slowing to a monthly rate of $35 billion. \\n  This detail hints at the fact that dealers were already expecting a slowdown in the Fed's purchasing efforts around the end of 2013. Minutes from the Fed's December meeting released Thursday caused a stir because it showed \\\"several\\\" policy-board members thinking it would be appropriate to rein in the program before year's end. \\n  Write to Cynthia Lin at cynthia.lin@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 14:25 ET (19:25 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529874,\"Headline\":\"NY Fed Releases Primary Dealer Poll\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357327500000)\\/\"}}"

The effort is meant to drive down long-term interest rates to encourage borrowing, spending and investing. \\n  Mr. Lacker was the only voting member of the committee to dissent from the decision. Under the Fed's system, his vote rotates to another regional bank president for 2013. \\n  Still, there appears to be clear disagreement among Fed officials on when to halt the bond-buying programs that are adding $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage securities to the central bank's assets. \\n  Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 11-12 policy meeting, released Thursday, showed that a few wanted to continue them until year-end, several others wanted to end the programs well before then and some wanted to halt them right away. \\n  Mr. Lacker said that further stimulus was unlikely to materially increase the pace of economic growth, which he forecast at around 2% this year. He also sees inflation at a little less than 2% in 2013, near the Fed's target. \\n  \\\"I see material upside risks to inflation in 2014 and beyond, given the current trajectory for monetary policy,\\\" Mr. Lacker said. \\n  Risk may arise as the Fed withdraws stimulus and starts to shrink its balance sheet, the Richmond Fed president said. \\n  \\\"The larger our balance sheet, the more vulnerable we will be to seemingly minor miscalibrations in policy,\\\" he said. \\n   --Jon Hilsenrath contributed to this article. \\n  Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 13:45 ET (18:45 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529865,\"Headline\":\"Fed's Lacker Sees Increased Risk of Inflation\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357325100000)\\/\"}}"

The jobless rate dropped from 7.2% to 7.1%, the lowest since the 6.8% posted in December 2008. \\n  The consensus call was for just 5,000 jobs to be added and the unemployment rate to climb to 7.3%, according to a report from Royal Bank of Canada. \\n  The Canadian dollar was firmer after the data and bond bond prices were modestly lower. \\n  The continued robustness of Canada's employment market is puzzling analysts who say it's unsustainable in an environment of slowing growth and global headwinds. \\n  \\\"It behooves me why Canadian employers are heaping on so much job growth in an environment in which there is next to no economic growth,\\\" Scotiabank economist Derek Holt said in an interview. \\n  Despite the hiring binge, employers are not working much more. Douglas Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, calculates that hours worked grew at an annualized rate of just 0.3% in the fourth quarter, which he says jibes well with his call for economic growth of just 1.2% in that period, much slower than the Bank of Canada's 2.5% forecast. \\n  \\\"It's almost like the economy is going on a job sharing scheme where informally, people are not working overtime, and average weekly hours are descending,\\\" Mr. Porter said in an interview. \\n  He said there was a \\\"sense\\\" in the markets that the central bank may have been prepared to back down on its hawkish bias in light of sluggish growth and inflation undershooting the 2% target by a wide margin, but the strong employment report likely means it will keep signaling potential rate hikes. Still, he doesn't expect the Bank to pull the rate-hike trigger until early 2014. \\n  There were 41,200 full-time positions added in December, while 1,400 part-time jobs were shed. The private sector created 59,400 jobs compared with just 3,200 in the public sector. The ranks of the self-employed was depleted by 22,800. \\n  Industries that saw the biggest gains included transportation and warehousing, construction and healthcare and social assistance. But thousands of jobs were shed in professional, scientific and technical services, natural resources and public administration. \\n  Manufacturing added 9,300 jobs--the most since May-- partially recovering the 19,600 positions lost in November. \\n  Overall, the goods-producing sector created 15,200 jobs and the services-producing sector added 24,500. \\n  The labor force increased by 27,300 and the participation rate, which is the share of the population in the labor force, held steady at 66.8%. \\n  Overall average hourly wages grew 2.4% year-on-year and the rate for permanent workers rose 2.5%. Both measures picked up a bit from November. \\n  Write to Nirmala Menon at nirmala.menon@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 13:35 ET (18:35 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529862,\"Headline\":\"Canada Job Growth Surprises\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357324500000)\\/\"}}"

The retailer also lowered its full-year earnings forecast and guided for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings below consensus estimates. \\n  Accuray ($5.44, -$1.34, -19.76%) said it is shedding about 13% of its workforce in a restructuring effort and expects significantly lower results for its fiscal second quarter as well as for 2013. The company develops and markets the CyberKnife, a robotic system designed to treat solid tumors. \\n  Coinstar ($49.83, -$2.22, -4.27%) said Thursday Chief Financial Officer J. Scott Di Valerio would succeed retiring Chief Executive Paul Davis in three months, while also projecting fourth-quarter earnings could beat company targets. The operator of Redbox DVD-rental kiosks volatile stock was undermined by strategy uncertainty and unease over earnings' drivers. \\n  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY, $51.28, +$1.56, +3.14%) expects its profit to rise in 2013 on potentially modest sales growth, even as the drug maker grapples with sales erosion from one of the steepest patent cliffs in the industry. The company also affirmed its commitments to fund its dividend and share buyback plans and said it could file for regulatory approval in 2013 of five drugs, including diabetes treatments dulaglutide and empagliflozin, as well as cancer treatments ramucirumab and enzastaurin. \\n  Deustche Bank upgraded its rating on shares of casual dining steak restaurant chain operator Texas Roadhouse Inc. (TXRH, $17.97, +$0.61, +3.51%) to buy from hold, saying that it believes beef inflation risk is already priced in. The investment bank also points to management's ability \\\"to grow earnings n the face of beef inflation and considerable multiple contraction.\\\" Meanwhile, Deustche Bank downgraded shares of upscale steak house restaurant chain owner Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. (RUTH, $7.55, -$0.15, -1.95%) to hold from buy, amid valuation concerns. \\\"As valuation has approached long-run average...consensus expectations have moved higher, and stock near our $8 price target,\\\" said the firm in a note to clients. \\n \\n   Other Stocks to Watch: \\n \\n  A. Schulman Inc.'s (SHLM, $30.40, +$1.30, +4.47%) fiscal first-quarter earnings fell 13% as the maker of plastic compounds and resins continued to post higher costs, masking higher revenue. Still shares beat analysts' expectations. \\n  Amicus Therapeutics Inc.'s (FOLD, $3.66, +$0.36, +10.91%) experimental drug for Pompe disease, duvoglustat HCI, performed better than standard therapy alone in a mid-stage trial, giving hope to patients with the rare and fatal genetic disorder and helping to restore investor confidence in the biopharmaceutical company. \\n  Automotive retailer AutoNation Inc. (AN, $42.10, +$1.52, +3.73%) reported its retail new vehicle sales rose 15% to 27,958 units in December from a year earlier. Its full-year retail new vehicle unit sales climbed 20% from 2011. \\n  Bill Barrett Corp. (BBG, $18.00, -$1.20, -6.25%) raised concerns about the oil and gas explorer's growth prospects this year following a 2013 outlook that included production guidance below Street estimates. In fairness, Raymond James' John Freeman tells Dow Jones, Bill Barrett also released lower-than-expected capital expenditure guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which \\\"was welcome news.\\\" But that was offset by the magnitude of the production hit, which Freeman says is roughly 20% below consensus estimates. \\n  Brown Shoe Co. (BWS, $17.00, -$1.22, -6.70%) shares were trading lower Friday after being downgraded to hold from buy by BB&T, which says the footwear retailer stands to be hit by a plateauing of running shoe sales, which have been integral to its Famous Footwear unit's growth. Famous Footwear is also at a disadvantage due to its inability to get premium basketball-style footwear, the firm said. \\n  Cray Inc. (CRAY, $16.48, +$0.23, +1.42%) lowered its 2012 revenue guidance as it wasn't able to complete a system upgrade at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before the year ended. The company--which provides highly advanced supercomputers and support services to government, industry and academia--said it now expects to complete the upgrade to the XK7 system at Oak Ridge during the first half of 2013. \\n  Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded shares of eHealth Inc. (EHTH, $25.63, -$1.61, -5.89%) to underperform from buy, saying in a note to clients that while it believes that eHealth has positioned itself for a strong 2013, \\\"our optimism is tempered by the stock's rich valuation.\\\" The investment bank also says that it expects strong fourth-quarter earnings from the online seller of health insurance, noting that \\\"this will be the first year the Medicare segment is fully built out.\\\" \\n  Endo Health Solutions Inc. (ENDP, $25.24, -$1.02, -3.87%) lowered its 2013 guidance as it expects higher charges related to its core painkiller franchise and generic-drug business. \\n  Independent energy company Harvest Natural Resources Inc. (HNR, $10.41, +$1.20, +13.03%) said it has another oil discovery in a well drilled in the Dussafu Marin PSC, in the offshore waters of Gabon, West Africa. \\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 13:30 ET (18:30 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529860,\"Headline\":\"U.S. HOT STOCKS: Finish Line, Accuray, Coinstar, Amicus Therapeutics, Harvest Natural\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357324200000)\\/\"}}"

Lewis \\n  BRASILIA--The Brazilian real ended Friday little changed against the dollar, recovering ground lost to the greenback earlier in the day after the country's finance minister said the government plans to ease back efforts to weaken the currency. \\n  The real exited active trading at BRL2.0347 to the dollar, according to Tullett Prebon via FactSet, after closing Thursday at BRL2.0346. The real traded weaker than 2.04 to the dollar for most of the morning. \\n  Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega spent much of 2012 working to boost Brazilian exports by weakening the real. This year the government is ready to interfere less, he said in an interview. \\n  \\\"2013 will be calmer, with fewer measures because they've been done,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\\"Monetary and exchange-rate policies are now adjusted.\\\" \\n  Facing declining growth over the last two years, Brazil lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate to a record low of 7.25% and introduced a barrage of measures to prevent its currency from strengthening against the dollar, such as capital controls on some foreign investment. \\n  \\\"Brazil now has to adapt, it has to get used to these levels of interest and exchange rates,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\\"Of course, there can always be fluctuations, both in terms of interest rate and the currency, but we're in a totally different position from where we were at the beginning of last year.\\\" \\n  The real started the day weaker against the dollar, then began to take back some of those losses late in the morning after U.S. payroll figures showed ongoing new job creation. U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 155,000 in December, slightly less than expected. \\n  \\\"That improved the mood in the market,\\\" said Reginaldo Galhardo, forex manager at the Treviso brokerage in Sao Paulo. \\n  Matthew Cowley in Brasilia contributed to this article \\n  Write to Jeffrey T.

But new technologies that allow for drilling in ever-deeper waters may have changed the outlook. \\n  The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate has said that some Dreki rocks show the potential for storing oil and gas, while others are similar in age to those in areas where finds have been make. \\n  \\\"Two important preconditions for possible petroleum deposits are thus in place,\\\" according to the NPD's Exploration Director Sissel Eriksen in a 2012 presentation. \\n  Both licenses involve the participation of Petoro, the state-owned Norwegian oil company. A 1981 agreement with Iceland gives Norway the right to an up-to 25% stake in exploration and production projects in the area, and Petoro has exercised this in both. \\n  Norway already has extensive oil and gas fields in nearby regions and can lay claim to resources in the Dreki region because of its ownership of Jan Mayen island, a volcanic outcrop 620 miles west of Norway, though only 370 miles from Iceland. Oil companies are tackling the challenging Arctic region from Alaska to Siberia in the hope of tapping some of the enormous reserves believed to be recoverable there. \\n  When the 1981 agreement was reached, the ridge that runs between Jan Mayen and Iceland's economic waters was found to be \\\"the only area which is considered to have the possibility of finding hydrocarbons,\\\" according to a United Nations report. \\n  Iceland currently produces no oil or natural gas, and the country's National Energy Authority says exploration on the Continental Shelf \\\"is in an early phase.\\\" \\n  Partnership with experienced explorers and producers--such as Norway, the largest oil producer in Europe after the Russian Federation, with output of over 2 million barrels a day in 2011--could therefore be vital. \\n  In the first of the two licenses, alongside Petoro's stake, U.K.-listed Faroe Petroleum PLC (FPM.LN) will take a 67.5% share. The remaining 7.5% goes to Iceland Petroleum, an oil company which concentrates specifically on the Dreki area, according to its website. \\n  The second license has been awarded to another U.K.-listed company, Valiant Petroleum PLC (VPP.LN), with 56.25%, Iceland Petroleum with 18.75%, and Petoro. \\n  Iceland, which has a population of only 319,000, has been struggling back towards economic stability after its three main banks collapsed in the financial crisis of 2008-2009. \\n  Attracting new sectors and foreign investment is critical for Iceland, but stringent capital controls that banned foreign investors from converting some forms of Icelandic krona-denominated assets into other currencies have discouraged this. Capital controls are expected to be in place until the end of 2015. \\n  Despite this, Iceland's economy has shown some recent signs of recovery, expanding by 2.4% in annual terms in the first half of 2012. In November, Iceland's central bank forecast a continuing of this trend, along with increased investment and an upturn in consumption. \\n  Oil and gas production could lead to a welcome injection of tax revenue. The current production levy of 5% on \\\"hydrocarbons processed from the resource,\\\" combined with a special hydrocarbon tax that is as yet unspecified, could have a significant impact on Iceland's per capita GDP--especially given its small population. \\n  Some political leaders have advocated for Iceland's adoption of the euro in order to lessen exposure to currency risk, but diversification, including hydrocarbon developments, might offer a less fraught route to prosperity. \\n  Write to Cassie Werber at cassie.werber@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 13:20 ET (18:20 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529857,\"Headline\":\"Iceland Taps Norway, UK Expertise for Nascent Oil Sector\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357323600000)\\/\"}}"

(HRL) after the owner of Spam canned meat and Dinty Moore canned stew said it will buy Unilever PLC's (UL, ULVR.LN) Skippy peanut-butter business. \\n  Moody's affirmed Hormel's rating at A2, five steps into investment grade. The outlook was revised to positive from stable. \\n  Hormel said Thursday that it agreed to pay $700 million for Skippy, as it seeks to expand its lunchtime offerings in the U.S. to non-meat products and accelerate growth in China. The Skippy brand, introduced in 1932, holds the second-largest market share in the U.S. and is the top-selling peanut butter in China. \\n  The outlook change \\\"reflects Moody's rising confidence that Hormel can sustain stable operating performance and a conservative financial profile even as it pursues growth through increasingly larger acquisitions,\\\" the ratings agency said. \\n  The firm believes that a measured pace of acquisitions can improve and diversify the food company's portfolio, while adding higher-margin businesses. \\n  Moody's outlook assumes that Hormel won't encounter any major integration challenges with its acquisitions. \\n  Hormel shares rose 2.5% to $34.04 in recent trading. The stock is up 9.1% so far this year. \\n  -Write to Kristin Jones at kristin.jones@dowjones.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 12:57 ET (17:57 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529846,\"Headline\":\"Moody's Lifts Outlook on Hormel, Noting Skippy Deal\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357322220000)\\/\"}}"

The unemployment rate, obtained by a separate survey of U.S. households, was 7.8%, the same as the prior month, after an upward revision to the November figure. \\n  The private sector led the job gains, adding 168,000 jobs in December, while governments continued to downsize, slashing 13,000 from payrolls, mainly at the local level. \\n  \\\"December's jobs numbers represent yet another good-not-great labor market report,\\\" said Guy LeBas, managing director of fixed income at Janney Capital Markets. \\n  Last month's readings were slightly worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 160,000 in payrolls and a 7.7% jobless rate. And the December gain was not enough to offset the increase in the labor force. Last month, 12.2 million Americans who wanted jobs couldn't find one. \\n  Friday's report is based on surveys taken in the middle of last month--well before the outcome of the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations were known. \\n  The Treasury Department's top economist said the latest numbers continue to reflect the \\\"gradual but steady\\\" improvement seen the past four years. Jan Eberly, assistant secretary for economic policy, said the fiscal cliff resolution should support additional gains. \\n  Earlier this week lawmakers struck a deal that raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans but will cause most workers to see their paychecks shrink as a payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire. A decision on federal spending cuts was put off. \\n  The tax agreement \\\"will help to fortify the recovery in the near term, laying the foundation for stronger job growth going forward, providing more certainty to taxpayers while also moving toward a more sustainable fiscal path,\\\" she said. \\n  Congressman Kevin Brady (R., Texas) said the Obama administration's policies have failed to support the labor market. \\n  \\\"I hope this is not the new normal,\\\" he said. \\\"We are still lacking faster growth driven by private business investment ... That's the missing ingredient that will accelerate job creation.\\\" \\n  Still, the private sector added 542,000 jobs during the final three months of 2012, compared with 419,000 during the third quarter. \\n  \\\"Companies were able to look past their stated concerns about the fiscal cliff heading into year-end, adding to payrolls despite the uncertainty,\\\" said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \\n  Avoiding the worst of the fiscal cliff has some economists projecting continued job gains this year, but others fret that the increased payroll tax will be a drag on consumer spending, a key driver of the economy, and could cause businesses to hire fewer workers in 2013. \\n  Rebuilding following superstorm Sandy, which struck the Northeast in late October, likely added to job growth last month. Nationally, employment in the construction sector advanced by 30,000 jobs last month after declining by 10,000 in November. In December, manufacturing and health-care payrolls increased, but retail employment fell. \\n  Average earnings rose by 7 cents to $23.73 an hour--the third consecutive monthly gain. However, over the past year, average earning have risen by 2.1%, barely enough to keep up with the 1.8% pace of inflation, the Labor Department said. \\n  Meanwhile, the average workweek advanced 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours. \\n  A broader measure of unemployment--which includes job seekers as well as those stuck in part-time jobs--was 14.4% in December, the same as the prior month. \\n  A separate report Friday showed the U.S. services sector picked up steam last month. \\n  The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index unexpectedly increased to 56.1 in December from 54.7 in November. December's reading was the highest since February 2012. \\n  Forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected last month's index to drop to 54.0. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding. \\n  -Kathleen Madigan contributed to this report. \\n  Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@dowjones.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 12:04 ET (17:04 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529827,\"Headline\":\"2nd UPDATE: U.S. Payrolls Grow Modestly in December, Up 155K; Jobless Rate 7.8%\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357319040000)\\/\"}}"

The unemployment rate, obtained by a separate survey of U.S. households, was 7.8%, the same as the prior month, after an upward revision to the November figure. \\n  The private sector led the job gains, adding 168,000 jobs in December, while governments continued to downsize, slashing 13,000 from payrolls, mainly at the local level. \\n  \\\"December's jobs numbers represent yet another good-not-great labor market report,\\\" said Guy LeBas, managing director of fixed income at Janney Capital Markets. \\n  Last month's readings were slightly worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 160,000 in payrolls and a 7.7% jobless rate. And the December gain was not enough to offset the increase in the labor force. Last month, 12.2 million Americans who wanted jobs couldn't find one. \\n  Friday's report is based on surveys taken in the middle of last month--well before the outcome of the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations were known. \\n  The Treasury Department's top economist said the latest numbers continue to reflect the \\\"gradual but steady\\\" improvement seen the past four years. Jan Eberly, assistant secretary for economic policy, said the fiscal cliff resolution should support additional gains. \\n  Earlier this week lawmakers struck a deal that raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans but will cause most workers to see their paychecks shrink as a payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire. A decision on federal spending cuts was put off. \\n  The tax agreement \\\"will help to fortify the recovery in the near term, laying the foundation for stronger job growth going forward, providing more certainty to taxpayers while also moving toward a more sustainable fiscal path,\\\" she said. \\n  Congressman Kevin Brady (R., Texas) said the Obama administration's policies have failed to support the labor market. \\n  \\\"I hope this is not the new normal,\\\" he said. \\\"We are still lacking faster growth driven by private business investment ... That's the missing ingredient that will accelerate job creation.\\\" \\n  Still, the private sector added 542,000 jobs during the final three months of 2012, compared with 419,000 during the third quarter. \\n  \\\"Companies were able to look past their stated concerns about the fiscal cliff heading into year-end, adding to payrolls despite the uncertainty,\\\" said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \\n  Avoiding the worst of the fiscal cliff has some economists projecting continued job gains this year, but others fret that the increased payroll tax will be a drag on consumer spending, a key driver of the economy, and could cause businesses to hire fewer workers in 2013. \\n  Rebuilding following superstorm Sandy, which struck the Northeast in late October, likely added to job growth last month. Nationally, employment in the construction sector advanced by 30,000 jobs last month after declining by 10,000 in November. In December, manufacturing and health-care payrolls increased, but retail employment fell. \\n  Average earnings rose by 7 cents to $23.73 an hour--the third consecutive monthly gain. However, over the past year, average earning have risen by 2.1%, barely enough to keep up with the 1.8% pace of inflation, the Labor Department said. \\n  Meanwhile, the average workweek advanced 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours. \\n  A broader measure of unemployment--which includes job seekers as well as those stuck in part-time jobs--was 14.4% in December, the same as the prior month. \\n  A separate report Friday showed the U.S. services sector picked up steam last month. \\n  The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index unexpectedly increased to 56.1 in December from 54.7 in November. December's reading was the highest since February 2012. \\n  Forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected last month's index to drop to 54.0. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding. \\n  -Kathleen Madigan contributed to this report. \\n  Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@dowjones.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 11:49 ET (16:49 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529817,\"Headline\":\"2nd UPDATE: U.S. Payrolls Grow Modestly in December, Up 155K; Jobless Rate 7.8%\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357318140000)\\/\"}}"

Among the companies with shares actively trading are Finish Line Inc. (FINL), Accuray Inc. (ARAY) and Coinstar Inc. (CSTR). \\n  Finish Line ($18.40, -$0.64, -3.36%) swung to a surprise loss in the fiscal third quarter as a weak response to its new online store hurt the athletic-gear retailer's sales. The company lowered its full-year earnings forecast and guided for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings below consensus estimates. \\n  Accuray ($5.28, -$1.51, -22.20%) said it is shedding about 13% of its workforce in a restructuring effort and expects significantly lower results for its fiscal second quarter as well as for 2013. The company develops and markets the CyberKnife, a robotic system designed to treat solid tumors. \\n  Coinstar ($49.16, -$2.89, -5.55%) said Thursday Chief Financial Officer J. Scott Di Valerio would succeed retiring Chief Executive Paul Davis in three months, while also projecting fourth-quarter earnings could beat company targets. The operator of Redbox DVD-rental kiosks volatile stock was undermined by strategy uncertainty and unease over earnings' drivers. \\n  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY, $51.76, +$2.04, +4.10%) predicted upbeat earnings in 2013 and affirmed its commitments to fund its dividend and share buyback plans, despite the company's recent struggles with drug patent expirations. \\n  Deustche Bank upgraded its rating on shares of casual dining steak restaurant chain operator Texas Roadhouse Inc. (TXRH, $18.04, +$0.68, +3.92%) to buy from hold, saying that it believes beef inflation risk is already priced in. The investment bank also points to management's ability \\\"to grow earnings n the face of beef inflation and considerable multiple contraction.\\\" Meanwhile, Deustche Bank downgraded shares of upscale steak house restaurant chain owner Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. (RUTH, $7.44, -$0.26, -3.38%) to hold from buy, amid valuation concerns. \\\"As valuation has approached long-run average...consensus expectations have moved higher, and stock near our $8 price target,\\\" said the firm in a note to clients. \\n \\n    Other Stocks To Watch: \\n \\n  A. Schulman Inc.'s (SHLM, $30.29, +$1.19, +4.09%) fiscal first-quarter earnings fell 13% as the maker of plastic compounds and resins continued to post higher costs, masking higher revenue. Still shares beat analysts' expectations. \\n  Amicus Therapeutics Inc. (FOLD, $3.74, +$0.44, +13.33%) reported positive preliminary results from all four cohorts of a Phase 2 study of its Pompe disease treatment, helping the biopharmaceutical company advance its study of the therapy. Based on the results, Amicus said it expects to initiate a repeat-dose clinical study in the third quarter of 2013. \\n  Cray Inc. (CRAY, $15.75, -$0.50, -3.09%) lowered its 2012 revenue guidance as it wasn't able to complete a system upgrade at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before the year ended. The company--which provides highly advanced supercomputers and support services to government, industry and academia--said it now expects to complete the upgrade to the XK7 system at Oak Ridge during the first half of 2013. \\n  Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded shares of eHealth Inc. (EHTH, $26.33, -$0.91, -3.32%) to underperform from buy, saying in a note to clients that while it believes that eHealth has positioned itself for a strong 2013, \\\"our optimism is tempered by the stock's rich valuation.\\\" The investment bank also says that it expects strong fourth-quarter earnings from the online seller of health insurance, noting that \\\"this will be the first year the Medicare segment is fully built out.\\\" \\n  Endo Health Solutions Inc. (ENDP, $25.26, -$0.99, -3.77%) lowered its 2013 guidance as it expects higher charges related to its core painkiller franchise and generic-drug business. \\n  Independent energy company Harvest Natural Resources Inc. (HNR, $10.48, +$1.27, +13.79%) said it has another oil discovery in a well drilled in the Dussafu Marin PSC, in the offshore waters of Gabon, West Africa. \\n  Progress Software Corp.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.1% increase. \\n  Despite the soft headline number, orders for durable goods--items meant to last at least three years--rose a healthy 0.8%, led by demand for metals and machinery. The figure was revised up from a previously reported 0.7% gain. \\n  Orders for motor vehicles climbed by 2.8%, while the volatile civilian aircraft sector plummeted 13.8%. \\n  Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 0.2% during November. \\n  A key measure of business investment--orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft--advanced 2.6%. \\n  Meanwhile, orders for non-durable goods such as petroleum, clothing and food declined by 0.6%. Petroleum and coal shipments tumbled 2.9%, reflecting lower energy prices. \\n  The manufacturing sector sent mixed signals last year amid broad uncertainty over policy in Washington. A report out earlier this week showed that factories barely returned to expansion last month even as employment picked up. \\n  The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index increased to 50.7 in December from 49.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity. \\n  \\\"We can look forward to a start of a good year in 2013\\\" given what was seen in December, said Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the factory survey for the ISM. \\n  And the sector added a solid 25,000 jobs in December, according to a separate Labor Department report out Friday. Manufacturers added 180,000 jobs during all of 2012--most in the first quarter of the year. \\n  In one move that may boost confidence, the White House and Congress this week brokered a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff--eliminating most impending tax increases and postponing spending cuts that had been set to kick in at the start of January. \\n  But they didn't increase the $16.394 trillion federal borrowing limit or set the parameters for entitlement and tax reform that will form the basis of any long-term deficit reduction agreement--setting up the next likely showdown. \\n  One area that escaped unscathed in the latest fiscal agreement was defense, though spending in November still slid. Orders for defense capital goods fell 0.5%. \\n  Excluding defense, total factory orders rose 0.1%. \\n  The Commerce Department report on factory orders can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3. \\n   -Kathleen Madigan contributed to this article. \\n  Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com and Jamila Trindle at jamila.trindle@dowjones.com. \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:25 ET (15:25 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529784,\"Headline\":\"U.S. November Factory Orders Flat\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357313100000)\\/\"}}"

The left-leaning SPD shed a point, falling to 29%. The Greens fell one point to 12% and the pro-business Free Democrats, Ms. Merkel's struggling junior coalition partner, remained steady at 4%. \\n  The results show that public support for Ms. Merkel's conservative alliance, at its highest level since 2007, is still on the rise. The previous ARD poll was published on Dec. 21. \\n  The SPD is suffering from a series of gaffes by its front-running candidate, Peer Steinbrueck, a former finance minister. Mr. Steinbrueck's campaign stumbled from the start in September, when details of his side earnings of nearly two million euros in speaking fees were made public. Only last week, he suggested that the German chancellor is underpaid considering the demands of the job and the high salaries earned by corporate executives. Such comments have sparked criticism that he is out of touch with ordinary Germans. \\n  While the new poll demonstrates the SPD's failure so far to stage a comeback, the poll also shows that Ms. Merkel's center-right coalition doesn't yet have the votes to stay in power beyond 2013. The FDP is still polling below the 5% threshold needed to win seats in parliament. That means that Ms. Merkel's conservative alliance may emerge the largest party and still not be able to form a government. \\n  The ARD poll was conducted by the polling agency Infratest dimap and is based on computer-assisted telephone interviews with 1,000 randomly selected eligible German voters between Jan. 2 and Jan. 3. The poll has a margin of error of 1.4 to 3.1 percentage points. \\n  Write to William Boston at William.Boston@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:24 ET (15:24 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529782,\"Headline\":\"Merkel's Party Extends Lead in Polls\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357313040000)\\/\"}}"

The unemployment rate, obtained by a separate survey of U.S. households, was 7.8%, the same as the prior month, after an upward revision to the November figure. \\n  The private sector lead the job gains, adding 168,000 jobs in December, while governments continued to downsize, slashing 13,000 from payrolls. \\n  \\\"December's jobs numbers represent yet another good-not-great labor market report,\\\" said Guy LeBas, managing director or fixed income at Janney Capital Markets. \\n  Last month's readings were slightly worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 160,000 in payrolls and a 7.7% jobless rate. And December jobs gains were not enough to offset the increase in the labor force. Last month, 12.2 million Americans who wanted jobs couldn't find one. \\n  Still, the private sector added 542,000 jobs during the final three months of 2012, compared with 419,000 during the third quarter. Friday's report is based on surveys taken in the middle of last month--well before the outcome of the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations were known. \\n  \\\"Companies were able to look past their stated concerns about the fiscal cliff heading into year-end, adding to payrolls despite the uncertainty,\\\" said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \\n   Earlier this week lawmakers stuck a deal that raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans and will cause most workers to see their paychecks shrink as a payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire. A decision on federal spending cuts was put off. \\n  Avoiding the worst of the fiscal cliff has some economists projecting continued job gains this year, but others fret that the increased payroll tax will be a drag on consumer spending, a key driver of the economy, and could cause businesses to hire fewer workers in 2013. \\n  Rebuilding following superstorm Sandy, which struck the Northeast in late October, likely added to job growth last month. Nationally, employment in the construction sector advanced by 30,000 jobs last month after declining by 10,000 in November. In December, manufacturing and health-care payrolls increased, but retail employment fell. \\n  Average earnings rose by 7 cents to $23.73 an hour--the third consecutive monthly gain. However, over the past year, average earning have rose by 2.1%, barely enough to keep up with the 1.8% pace of inflation, the Labor Department said. \\n  Meanwhile, the average workweek advanced 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours. \\n  A broader measure of unemployment--which includes job seekers as well as those stuck in part-time jobs--was 14.4% in December, the same as the prior month. \\n  Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@dowjones.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:17 ET (15:17 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529777,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: U.S. Payrolls Grow Modestly in December, Up 155K; Jobless Rate 7.8%\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357312620000)\\/\"}}"

Unch  ! \\n===================================================== \\n \\n   By Jeffrey Sparshott and Jamila Trindle \\n \\n   WASHINGTON--U.S. factory orders were roughly flat in November, reflecting lower oil prices. \\n  Orders for manufactured goods rose only $211 million to $477.65 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.1% increase. \\n  Despite the soft headline number, orders for durable goods--items meant to last at least three years--rose a healthy 0.8%, led by demand for metals and machinery. The figure was revised up from a previously reported 0.7% gain. \\n  Orders for motor vehicles climbed by 2.8%, while the volatile civilian aircraft sector plummeted 13.8%. \\n  Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 0.2% during November. \\n  A key measure of business investment--orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft--advanced 2.6%. \\n  Meanwhile, orders for non-durable goods such as petroleum, clothing and food declined by 0.6%. Petroleum and coal shipments tumbled 2.9%, reflecting lower energy prices. \\n  The manufacturing sector sent mixed signals last year amid broad uncertainty over policy in Washington. A report out earlier this week showed that factories barely returned to expansion last month even as employment picked up. \\n  The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index increased to 50.7 in December from 49.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity. \\n  \\\"We can look forward to a start of a good year in 2013\\\" given what was seen in December, said Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the factory survey for the ISM. \\n  And the sector added a solid 25,000 jobs in December, according to a separate Labor Department report out Friday. Manufacturers added 180,000 jobs during all of 2012--most in the first quarter of the year. \\n  In one move that may boost confidence, the White House and Congress this week brokered a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff--eliminating most impending tax increases and postponing spending cuts that had been set to kick in at the start of January. \\n  But they didn't increase the $16.394 trillion federal borrowing limit or set the parameters for entitlement and tax reform that will form the basis of any long-term deficit reduction agreement--setting up the next likely showdown. \\n  One area that escaped unscathed in the latest fiscal agreement was defense, though spending in November still slid. Orders for defense capital goods fell 0.5%. \\n  Excluding defense, total factory orders rose 0.1%. \\n  The Commerce Department report on factory orders can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3. \\n  -Kathleen Madigan contributed to this article. \\n  Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com and Jamila Trindle at jamila.trindle@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:15 ET (15:15 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529775,\"Headline\":\"U.S. November Factory Orders Flat\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357312500000)\\/\"}}"

The unemployment rate, obtained by a separate survey of U.S. households, was 7.8%, the same as the prior month, after an upward revision to the November figure. \\n  The private sector lead the job gains, adding 168,000 jobs in December, while governments continued to downsize, slashing 13,000 from payrolls. \\n  \\\"December's jobs numbers represent yet another good-not-great labor market report,\\\" said Guy LeBas, managing director or fixed income at Janney Capital Markets. \\n  Last month's readings were slightly worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 160,000 in payrolls and a 7.7% jobless rate. And December jobs gains were not enough to offset the increase in the labor force. Last month, 12.2 million Americans who wanted jobs couldn't find one. \\n  Still, the private sector added 542,000 jobs during the final three months of 2012, compared with 419,000 during the third quarter. Friday's report is based on surveys taken in the middle of last month--well before the outcome of the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations were known. \\n  \\\"Companies were able to look past their stated concerns about the fiscal cliff heading into year-end, adding to payrolls despite the uncertainty,\\\" said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \\n   Earlier this week lawmakers stuck a deal that raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans and will cause most workers to see their paychecks shrink as a payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire. A decision on federal spending cuts was put off. \\n  Avoiding the worst of the fiscal cliff has some economists projecting continued job gains this year, but others fret that the increased payroll tax will be a drag on consumer spending, a key driver of the economy, and could cause businesses to hire fewer workers in 2013. \\n  Rebuilding following superstorm Sandy, which struck the Northeast in late October, likely added to job growth last month. Nationally, employment in the construction sector advanced by 30,000 jobs last month after declining by 10,000 in November. In December, manufacturing and health-care payrolls increased, but retail employment fell. \\n  Average earnings rose by 7 cents to $23.73 an hour--the third consecutive monthly gain. However, over the past year, average earning have rose by 2.1%, barely enough to keep up with the 1.8% pace of inflation, the Labor Department said. \\n  Meanwhile, the average workweek advanced 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours. \\n  A broader measure of unemployment--which includes job seekers as well as those stuck in part-time jobs--was 14.4% in December, the same as the prior month. \\n  Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@dowjones.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:02 ET (15:02 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529768,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: U.S. Payrolls Grow Modestly in December, Up 155K; Jobless Rate 7.8%\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357311720000)\\/\"}}"

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.1% increase. \\n  Despite the soft headline number, orders for durable goods--items meant to last at least three years--rose a healthy 0.8%, led by demand for metals and machinery. The figure was revised up from a previously reported 0.7% gain. \\n  Orders for motor vehicles climbed by 2.8%, while the volatile civilian aircraft sector plummeted 13.8%. \\n  Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 0.2% during November. \\n  A key measure of business investment--orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft--advanced 2.6%. \\n  Meanwhile, orders for non-durable goods such as petroleum, clothing and food declined by 0.6%. Petroleum and coal shipments tumbled 2.9%, reflecting lower energy prices. \\n  The manufacturing sector sent mixed signals last year amid broad uncertainty over policy in Washington. A report out earlier this week showed that factories barely returned to expansion last month even as employment picked up. \\n  The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index increased to 50.7 in December from 49.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity. \\n  \\\"We can look forward to a start of a good year in 2013\\\" given what was seen in December, said Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the factory survey for the ISM. \\n  And the sector added a solid 25,000 jobs in December, according to a separate Labor Department report out Friday. Manufacturers added 180,000 jobs during all of 2012--most in the first quarter of the year. \\n  In one move that may boost confidence, the White House and Congress this week brokered a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff--eliminating most impending tax increases and postponing spending cuts that had been set to kick in at the start of January. \\n  But they didn't increase the $16.394 trillion federal borrowing limit or set the parameters for entitlement and tax reform that will form the basis of any long-term deficit reduction agreement--setting up the next likely showdown. \\n  One area that escaped unscathed in the latest fiscal agreement was defense, though spending in November still slid. Orders for defense capital goods fell 0.5%. \\n  Excluding defense, total factory orders rose 0.1%. \\n  The Commerce Department report on factory orders can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3. \\n  -Kathleen Madigan contributed to this article. \\n  Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com and Jamila Trindle at jamila.trindle@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529766,\"Headline\":\"U.S. November Factory Orders Flat\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357311600000)\\/\"}}"

The measures have attracted criticism from some analysts who say they deter investment and potentially risk inflation, all while failing to secure a turnaround. Brazil's economy slowed to around 1% in 2012 after notching only 2.7% growth in 2011. \\n  Mr. Mantega countered the critics, saying that the steps were starting to take effect and would help push Latin America's biggest economy to growth rates between 3% and 4% this year and above 4% in 2014. \\n  \\\"We are starting with a better international scenario and we will start to reap what we sowed in 2011 and 2012,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. He said Brazil's economy started to accelerate in the final months of 2012, while the outlook for the U.S. has improved, Europe's debt crisis appears to have avoided a worst-case scenario and China's growth rate is starting to pick up again. \\n  Mr. Mantega, 63, came to global prominence in 2010 by accusing the U.S. and Europe of engaging in a \\\"currency war\\\" for introducing policies that he said weakened the dollar and the euro at the expense of emerging market economies such as Brazil, making the emerging market countries less competitive in the process. The capital controls Mr. Mantega introduced were designed to prevent cheap dollars from flooding into Brazil and strengthening the real. \\n  Those controls, combined with weaker economic growth and the lower interest rates, have weakened the currency by about 25% against the dollar since mid-2011. On Friday, the real was trading at around BRL2.05 per dollar. \\n  \\\"The exchange rate is in a favorable position,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\\"Interest rates and currency, the main variables, are in a state of more equilibrium than at the beginning of 2012.\\\" \\n  The currency now \\\"floats more according to the flavor of the market,\\\" he said. \\n  The minister acknowledged that too much depreciation can be a bad thing: the real's weakening in 2012 probably contributed 0.5 percentage point to inflation in 2012, and a weaker currency also makes it more expensive to import much-needed manufacturing equipment. \\n  \\\"An exchange rate that's very depreciated can also be inconvenient,\\\" he said. \\n  Meanwhile, Mr. Mantega said tax breaks and other measures Brazil introduced to stimulate automobile sales saved jobs, helping Brazil maintain unemployment at a record low. \\n  \\\"High employment is not a miracle,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\n  The government's sometimes frenetic policy-making pace also earned critics who say the goverment is intervening so much that it scares off investors wary of unexpected changes. A case in point is the reaction to the government's move to cut consumers' electric power bills by asking power companies to renew contracts coming due at less profitable terms, which was seen by some as heavy-handed. \\n  Mr. Mantega said he was unphased by the criticisms, as, although a few may complain, the majority will benefit. The government is planning another such reform this year in order to lower natural gas prices, and may yet extend some more payroll tax cuts. \\n  \\\"This is good activism, they are all healthy measures not just to bear fruit in one or two years in the coming decades,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a new Brazil that is being born.\\\" \\n  Mr. Mantega predicted that Brazilian equities stand to benefit from renwed economic growth. \\\"The decline in the interest rate and the outlook for growth to recover will make the Brazilian stock market grow more this year,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\n  \\\"I think the main risks have been overcome,\\\" Mr. Mantega said. \\\"I see a scenario of bonanza in 2013.\\\" \\n  Mr. Mantega's sunny outlook is somewhat at odds with his the record of the last two years. In both 2011 and 2012, he predicted growth rates for Brazil that far outpaced the actual results. He said his optimism this year is justified by recent economic results, and is generally good for the country. \\n  Write to Matthew Cowley at matthew.cowley@dowjones.com, Luciana Magalhaes at luciana.magalhaes@dowjones.com and John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com \\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 09:55 ET (14:55 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529748,\"Headline\":\"Brazil's Finance Minister Says to Ease Back on Stimulus Measures\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357311300000)\\/\"}}"

The benchmark rate was cut twice in total coming down from 4.75% to 4.25%. \\n  In a sign of a similar slowing trend, Hungary is set to see its industrial output plunge further. Weak leading indicators, soft orders data and an ongoing fiscal contraction are to be blamed for this, Gabor Ambrus, economist at 4Cast said. \\n  \\\"Despite the large forecast error for individual months in the current period, in bigger picture terms, we look for a poor underlying trend,\\\" Mr. Ambrus said. \\n  Hungary saw three consecutive quarters of economic contraction last year and the central bank expects to see only very limited growth in 2013, very close to stagnation. \\n  In Prague, while the economic contraction since late 2011 could also lead to annual declines in industrial output and retail sales, headline inflation is seen safely in the upper end of the Czech central bank's 1% to 3% target range. \\n  Analysts and the central bank say domestic inflationary pressures aren't evident, in line with a weak domestic demand. However, the weak economic outlook in the euro zone--the largest trading partner for the Czech Republic--is weighing on export growth, and ongoing fiscal consolidation is also taking its toll on employment. \\n  \\\"In the following months, the situation on the labor market is expected to deteriorate further; industrial companies are likely to be cautious about hiring new employees and more layoffs expected,\\\" said Jiri Skop, an economist at Komercni Banka. \\n \\nDate   GMT  Country Indicator    Period Forecast     Previous \\nJan 07 0800 CZE Indus Output     Nov    -1.5%YY(6)   +4.1%YY \\nJan 07 0800 CZE Foreign Trade    Nov    +CZK23.3B(6) +CZK33B \\nJan 07 1030 HUN Liquidity T-Bill Tender N/A          N/A \\nJan 08 0730 HUN FX Reserves      Dec    N/A          EUR33.87M \\nJan 08 0800 HUN Adj Indus Output Nov    -3.3%YY(3)   -1.7%YY \\nJan 08 1030 HUN 3-Month T-Bill   Tender N/A          5.49%* \\nJan 09 0800 CZE CPI              Dec    +2.4%YY(7)   +2.7%YY \\nJan 09 0800 CZE Jobless          Dec    9.4%YY(6)    8.7%YY \\nJan 09 0800 HUN Trade Balance    Nov    EUR785M(3)   EUR657.6M \\nJan 09 1100 CZE 4-Yr Bond Auction       N/A          -9.298BPs** \\nJan 09 1100 CZE Premier 6Y Bond  Tender N/A          N/A \\nJan 09 N/A  POL Interest rates   Jan    4.0%(19)     4.25% \\nJan 11 0800 CZE Retail Sales   Nov      -0.1%YY(5)   +2.2%YY \\n \\nNotes: \\n   Numbers in brackets indicate the number of analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. \\n   N/A indicates \\\"not available\\\" or \\\"not applicable.\\\" Some amounts denoted as previous are rounded. \\n   *   - Average auction yield. \\n   **  - Finance ministry forecast. \\n \\n  -Write to Veronika Gulyas at veronika.gulyas@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 09:50 ET (14:50 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529745,\"Headline\":\"Polish Rate Cut, Czech CPI in Central European Focus Next Week\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357311000000)\\/\"}}"

Ratings are AA3 from Moody's Investors Service Inc., and A+ from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. \\n  Caisse de Refinancement de l'Habitat, the French mortgage-loan refinancing agency, sold a EUR1 billion, 12-year covered bond.

Iceland has been seeking paths to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which resulted in the collapse of its three main banks and devastated its economy. \\n  Both of the new licenses involve Petoro, the state-owned Norwegian oil company. An agreement between Iceland and Norway, in place since 1981, gives the latter the right to participate in exploration and production projects in the area, with up to a 25% stake. \\n  Petoro has exercised this right in both the licenses issued Friday for the area, which lies to the north and east of Iceland. Norway already has extensive oil and gas fields in nearby regions, off its western coast. \\n  In the first of the two licenses, alongside Petoro's stake, U.K.-listed independent company Faroe Petroleum PLC (FPM.LN) will take a 67.5% share. The remaining 7.5% goes to Iceland Hydrocarbons, an oil company that concentrates specifically on the Dreki area, according to its website. \\n  The second license has been awarded to another U.K.-listed firm, Valiant Petroleum PLC (VPP.LN), with a 56.25% share, and Iceland Hydrocarbons with 18.75%, as well as Petoro. \\n  Norway is the largest oil producer in Europe after the Russian Federation, and produced over 2 million barrels a day in 2011, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy. It produced 3,582 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \\n  Iceland, meanwhile, currently produces no oil or natural gas at all, according to the EIA. The country's National Energy Authority website states: \\\"Exploration for oil and gas on the Icelandic Continental Shelf is in an early phase\\\". \\n  The tiny nation, which has a population of only 319,000, has been struggling back towards economic stability over the past four years. Its economy expanded by 2.4%, in annual terms, in the first half of 2012. \\n  In November, its central bank forecast a continuing of this trend, along with increased investment and an upturn in consumption. \\n  Write to Cassie Werber at cassie.werber@dowjones.com \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 08:55 ET (13:55 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529718,\"Headline\":\"Iceland Launches Hydrocarbons Drive With First E&P Permits\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357307700000)\\/\"}}"

The unemployment rate, obtained by a separate survey of U.S. households, was 7.8%, the same as the prior month, after an upward revision to the November figure. \\n  Both readings were slightly worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 160,000 in payrolls and a 7.7% jobless rate. \\n  Friday's report is based on surveys taken in the middle of last month--well before the outcome of the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations were known. \\n  Once again, private sector businesses lead the job growth, adding 168,000 jobs to payrolls. However, growth outside the government slowed a bit from November. \\n  Rebuilding following superstorm Sandy, which struck the Northeast in late October, likely added to job growth last month. Nationally, employment in the construction sector advanced by 30,000 jobs. Meanwhile, manufacturing payrolls increased by 25,000 and health care jobs grew by 45,000. \\n  The government continued to downsize in December as public sector employment declined by 13,000. The federal work force shrank by 3,000 and local government payrolls fell by 14,000. State government jobs increased last month. \\n  Earlier this week lawmakers stuck a deal that raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans and will cause most workers to see their paychecks shrink as a payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire. A decision on federal spending cuts was put off. \\n  The increased payroll tax will be a drag on consumer spending, a key driver of the economy, and could cause businesses to hire fewer workers in 2013, JPMorgan Chase Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli said Thursday. \\n  While December's report showed a slower pace of gains, job creation in November was revised up to 161,000 from an initially reported 146,000. \\n  Average earnings rose by 7 cents to $23.73 an hour, while the average workweek advanced 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours. \\n  A broader measure of unemployment--which includes job seekers as well as those stuck in part-time jobs--was 14.4% in December, the same as the prior month. The data showed even with the job growth, 12.2 million people who wanted a job couldn't find one last month, a slight increase from November. \\n  The Labor Department's employment report can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.tochtm \\n   Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@dowjones.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@dowjones.com. \\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n  January 04, 2013 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT)\",\"StoryId\":1529698,\"Headline\":\"U.S. December Nonfarm Payrolls Up 155K; Jobless Rate 7.8%\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1357306200000)\\/\"}}"

Final figures will be released at month's end and are likely to come in well below the target of 3.1% of GDP. But the problem is less serious than it seems, according to Ricardo Denadi at Santander Brasil Asset Management. \\\"The decline in interest rates will compensate for any rise in government spending in 2013,\\\" he says. \\\"The trend for net debt is actually downward.\\\" Brazil's central bank has reduced its Selic base rate systematically from 2011's peak of 12.5% to the current all-time low of 7.25%.
