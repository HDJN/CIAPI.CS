{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \nMARKET NEWS: \nFTSE 100           5884.90  +45.84  +0.79% \nFTSE 250          12081.55  +51.09  +0.42% \nFTSE AIM All-Share  699.23   -0.66  -0.09% \nTuesday's closing prices \n  London Stocks Expected To Start A Touch Higher \n  0714 GMT [Dow Jones] FTSE 100 is expected to start mildly higher, up by just five points at 5890 says Michael Hewson at CMC Markets. Investors will be digesting the results of the Presidential election. A second term for President Obama suggests continuity with respect to the economic policies of the last four years says Hewson. Greece will also garner some attention Wednesday as its parliament gathers to vote on a new austerity budget. Measures are expected to be passed, but that doesn't mean Greece's problems are over. There are no UK economic data of note Wednesday. There are plenty of earnings scheduled for release. Burberry and FirstGroup are amongst those reporting. \n \nTOP NEWS: \n  GLOBAL MARKETS: Dollar Down, Stocks Called Up after Obama Win \n  Europe's financial markets are opening with equities called higher and the dollar weaker in the wake of President Barack Obama's victory in the U.S. presidential election. \n \nCOMPANIES NEWS: \n  Burberry Profit Falls On Fragrance Charge \n  Burberry PLC (BRBY.LON) Wednesday said first-half net profit fell 27% due to a charge on its perfume business, but revenue and margins were better than expected despite a slowdown in its key Asian markets which led to a profit warning in September. \n  Randgold Earnings Misses Views As Tongon Hit By Power Outages \n  West Africa gold producer Randgold Resources PLC (GOLD) Wednesday reported lower-than-expected third quarter profit due in part to lower gold production stemming from power interruptions at its Tongon mine in the Ivory Coast and the production of lower ore grades at the Gounkoto mine in Mali. \n  Old Mutual Funds Under Management Up 4% to GBP263.3B \n  Old Mutual PLC (OML.LN), an international long-term savings group, said Wednesday funds under management in core operations during the third quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 4% to 263.3 billion pounds with net client cash outflows of GBP0.5 billion, compared with GBP5.4 billion a year earlier. \n  Vedanta Resources Reports Rise in 1H Profit to $1.06B \n  Vedanta Resources PLC (VED.LN), a diversified natural resources company, Wednesday reported a rise in first half pretax profit and said that emerging markets continue to be the major contributor to growth. \n  FirstGroup 1H Pretax Profit Declines, Trading in Line With Expectations \n  FirstGroup PLC (FGP.LN), a transport operator, recorded Wednesday a decline in half year pretax profit and said trading during the first half of the year is in line with expectations. \n  Stagecoach Group Buys North Manchester Bus Operator for GBP2M \n  Bus and rail firm Stagecoach Group PLC (SGC.LN) said Wednesday its wholly-owned subsidiary Greater Manchester Buses South Ltd. has agreed to buy the bus business and assets of private operator Bluebird for 2.0 million pounds. \n \nBROKER COMMENTS: \n  Burberry 1H Shows Strong Margin; Inventory Control-Nomura \n  0746 GMT [Dow Jones] Burberry's (BRBY.LN) 1H results indicate a strong margin and good inventory management, says Nomura. \"High store contribution margins, cost control and reduced bonus accruals provided the leverage for margin growth,\" Nomura adds. Notes Burberry repeats its 2H guidance for flat underlying wholesale sales, flat FY licensing revenues and 14% retail space growth. Thinks Burberry has anticipated slower markets well and has the capability to mitigate more risk than in previous cycles. Nomura maintains its 2H estimates. \"While the stock has traded up strongly, we would look for any pullbacks to become more constructive on the name,\" Nomura adds. Keeps at neutral, 1with 210p target price. Shares closed at 1252p. \n  Burberry 1H Tad Better-Than-Expected -Seymour \n  0737 GMT [Dow Jones] Burberry (BRBY.LN) first-half earnings are slightly better-than-expected, Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert says. The market will be reassured that Burberry bringing Burberry perfume license back in-house will be earnings-neutral in 2014 and enhancing thereafter, Calvert says. There may be some small upgrades to forecasts following these results, she adds. Recommendation is buy, 1500p target. Shares closed Tuesday at 1252p. \n  UBS Downgrades Inmarsat to Neutral from Buy \n  0727 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS downgrades Inmarsat (ISAT.LN) to neutral from buy and lowers its price target to 575p from 600p. The moves follow the company's interim management statement on Nov. 5. UBS says maritime and core revenue trends appeared to weaken in 3Q, versus UBS's estimates. Cost control remains impressive but the raised 2013 operating expenditure takes UBS's Ebitda forecasts below consensus and delays the increase in cash flow. It says, \"With no cash-flow growth until 2014, investors may have to wait until 2016 for shares to reach a sector cash yield.\" UBS cuts its 2013 EPS forecast for Inmarsat to $0.53 from $0.58. Shares closed Tuesday at 573p. \n  Citigroup Cuts Pennon To Sell, Severn Trent To Neutral \n  0724 GMT [Dow Jones] Citigroup cuts Pennon (PNN.LN) to sell from neutral and downgrades Severn Trent (SVT.LN) to neutral from buy. Says Pennon valuation is rich. Adds the low dividend yield of 4% and 15% regulatory capital value premium in 2014E is not reflective of the regulatory risk and lower-than-average RCV growth in the water business, nor of the reduced visibility in the cyclical parts of Viridor and execution risk on the energy from waste pipeline. For Severn Trent, cuts Services forecasts due to the sale of analytics and some operational weakness. Adds the payment of the special dividend is now behind us, while there's a clouded regulatory outlook ahead. Cuts Pennon target to 650p from 720p, Severn target to 1520p from 1685p. \n  UBS Downgrades Babcock To Neutral From Buy \n  0715 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS downgrades Babcock International Group (BAB.LN) to neutral from buy, but keeps 1000p price target. Says near-term upside is limited. \"Having re-rated strongly over the last 12 months on the back of contract wins and improving organic growth we think a further rerating requires further material contract wins,\" says UBS. As such, the bank thinks the shares are unlikely to do much in the next six-to-nine months. Notes the vast majority of Babcock's pipeline comes up during FY 2014. Raises 2013 EPS forecast to 68.72p from 68.44p, but cuts 2014 to 69.48p from 70.46p. Shares closed at 954.5p. \n  Contact: London Services, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9319 \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 07, 2012 02:53 ET (07:53 GMT)","StoryId":1505251,"Headline":"UK Summary: Cautious Welcome for Obama Victory","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352274780000)\/"}}

The issue of the U.S. 'fiscal cliff' will now take center stage. As for Paris stocks, French banks are in focus after BNP Paribas reported 3Q results which are slightly better-than-expected, trader says.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n   By Surabhi Sahu \n \n  Nymex crude trimmed losses from early Asian trade Wednesday as U.S. President Barack Obama won a second term in office, ending the uncertainty that shrouded markets worldwide before the Democrat defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney in a grueling election contest. \n  Brent crude was flat since the morning but has since edged upward, reacting mildly to Mr. Obama's victory. Support for Brent will still likely be supply risks from the Middle East and North Sea, traders said. \n  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in December traded at $88.58 a barrel at 0719 GMT, down $0.13 in the Globex electronic session. December Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange rose $0.05 to $111.12 a barrel. \n  Mr. Obama's victory has eliminated market uncertainty, supporting crude prices, said Victor Shum, managing director of Downstream Energy Consulting, tipping support for the U.S. benchmark at $85 a barrel today. \n  In the longer term, however, crude-oil prices will likely retreat due to rising inventories amid slowing demand, he said, forecasting the Brent-WTI spread to narrow to $15 a barrel by year-end in the absence of any significant geopolitical developments in the Middle East. \n  Mr. Obama's win will likely spur dollar sales due to a loose monetary policy, a Tokyo-based trader said. A weaker dollar is usually positive for oil prices, as dollar-denominated commodities become less expensive to holders of other currencies when the greenback weakens. The WSJ dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, was last at 70.22 from 70.44 late Tuesday in New York. \n  The election dust has settled and investors will eye fundamentals--inventory data from the Energy Information Administration due late Wednesday, Phillip Capital analyst Ker Chung Yang said. \n  Crude-oil inventories likely rose by 1.9 million barrels last week, according to analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Oil prices will likely edge lower if inventories rise more than analysts expect, Mr. Ker said. \n  Investors will also be looking for cues from China's 18th Party Congress, which kicks off Thursday, to determine whether policy makers are prepared to take additional steps to boost growth, traders said. \n  Meanwhile, Greece's parliament is set to vote on an austerity bill Wednesday and take up the nation's 2013 budget over the weekend. \n  Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for December--the benchmark gasoline contract--rose 1 points to $2.6990 a gallon, while December heating oil traded at $3.0505, 24 points lower. \n  ICE gasoil for November changed hands at $951.00 a metric ton, up $14.00 from Tuesday's settlement. \n  Write to Surabhi Sahu at surabhi.sahu@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 07, 2012 02:25 ET (07:25 GMT)","StoryId":1505240,"Headline":"OIL FUTURES: Nymex Crude Trims Losses on Obama Victory; Stocks Data Ahead","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352273100000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  PARIS--French bank BNP Paribas SA (BNP.FR) Wednesday said it has completed restructuring kicked off last year to meet Europe's new banking rules and that third-quarter net profit more than doubled thanks to investment-banking revenue. \n  The Paris-based lender, France's largest listed bank, said third-quarter net profit rose to 1.32 billion euros ($1.69 billion), from EUR541 million in the same quarter last year, beating analysts' expectations of EUR1.25 billion. \n  BNP Paribas' rise in earnings underscores the sharp turnaround in global debt markets, prompted in part by recent bond-buying initiatives announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. European and U.S. banks including Deutsche Bank AG (DB), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Citigroup and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) reported last month big gains in their quarterly investment-banking operations. \n  BNP Paribas posted a 33.2% jump to EUR2.38 billion in corporate- and investment-banking revenue, buoyed by its fixed-income and advisory businesses. \n  Domestic retail banking, however, showed signs of weakening, as France continues to struggle with rising unemployment and eroding purchasing power. Retail banking revenue slipped 2.1% to EUR1.71 billion from EUR1.75 billion. \n  Total revenue fell 3.4% to EUR9.70 billion owing to a EUR774 million accounting charge stemming from a rule that requires banks to book a loss when the value of their debt rises. \n  BNP Paribas has moved quickly to meet Europe's tougher capital rules and cope with the sovereign debt crisis. The bank said Wednesday it has completed restructuring aimed at increasing its capital reserves--to cushion against unexpected shocks--and reducing dependence on volatile financial markets. Over the past fifteen months, the bank has cut its dollar-funding needs by $65 billion and reduced its risk-weighted assets by around EUR79 billion. \n  At the end of September, the bank's Core Tier 1 ratio under Basel III rules--made up of only top-quality capital such as equity and retained profit--stood at 9.5%, well ahead of the bank's 9% year-end target. \n  BNP Paribas opened earnings season for French banks.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n     0608 GMT  [Dow Jones] ASIAN SUMMARY: Regional markets are mostly higher amid expectations easy monetary policy will continue in the U.S. without major disruptions, following a flurry of news reports that Barack Obama has secured enough votes to retain the presidency. AFP reports that with a clutch of swing states, including Florida and Virginia still to be declared, Obama already had 275 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed for the White House and looks set for a comfortable victory. The Nikkei is flat, the S&P/ASX rises 0.7%, the HSI rises 0.2%, the Kospi gains 0.5%, the Taiex rises 0.7%, the Sensex adds 0.5%, the Shanghai Composite falls 0.1% and the STI gains 0.6%. In FX markets, the dollar is weaker with investors sensing a U.S. election victory for monetary-easing advocate President Barack Obama. Still, traders in Tokyo say the greenback may start rising as the market's focus shifts to fiscal cliff issues once Mr. Obama's re-election--already called by all major U.S. TV networks--is confirmed. The USD/JPY is at 80.10 from 80.36 late Tuesday in New York, the EUR/USD is at 1.2863 from 1.2816, and the EUR/JPY is at 103.03 from 102.99. Beijing should widen \"considerably\" the yuan's trading band against the U.S. dollar as an inflexible exchange rate has constrained the Chinese central bank's ability to adjust monetary policy, a prominent economist with a government think tank writes in an article published in the state-run China Securities Journal Wednesday.

President Barack Obama won key swing states but with only about half of the country counting votes by the European morning, his challenger Mitt Romney still was holding even. \n  Investors will keep a close eye on developments in the euro zone as a Greek parliamentary ruling is due on an austerity bill which proposes billions of euros in new cuts and reforms. Thousands of Greek people Tuesday started a two-day strike against the austerity measures. Market focus also remains on Spain which has continued to delay a formal request for a bailout from the European Union. \n  In the Nordic region, the third quarter earnings season continues and investors will be keen to eye the results from Danish companies like brewer Carlsberg (CARL-A.KO), pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck (LUN.KO) and wind turbines maker Vestas Wind Systems (VWS.KO). \n  Furthermore, minutes are due from the Swedish central bank's latest policy meeting. \n \nFOREX: \n \nEUR/NOK \nLatest 0250 GMT  7.3163-230 \nPrevious 2150 GMT 7.3180-270 \n%Chg  -0.04 \n \nEUR/SEK \nLatest 0250 GMT  8.5543-98 \nPrevious 2150 GMT 8.5625-748 \n%Chg -0.14 \n \n \nUSD/NOK \nLatest 0250 GMT  5.7147-96 \nPrevious 2150 GMT 5.7111-70 \n%Chg +0.05 \n \n \nUSD/SEK \nLatest 0250 GMT  6.6817-56 \nPrevious 2150 GMT  6.6825-907 \n%Chg -0.04 \n \n \nNORDIC CURRENCIES: \n  Currency investors will have the U.S. presidential election result as their first priority on Wednesday. A victory by Mitt Romney would be viewed as positive for the U.S. dollar because of the Republican candidate's opposition to monetary easing, whereas the re-election of Barack Obama could be negative for the USD in the short-term. \n  In the Scandinavian region, investors will scrutinize the minutes from the latest Riksbank monetary policy meeting when they are published at 0830 GMT. \n  \"Given the new macroeconomic projections in the October monetary policy report of weak Swedish growth and inflation close to zero, we will look at just how close the majority was cutting rates already in October,\" SEB said Tuesday. However, as both the market and a large majority of economists expects a 25 basis point rate cut in December, \"the October Minutes are not likely to provide any major news for the FX market,\" SEB said. \n  SEB also noted that the market is no longer paying the same amount of attention to the Swedish currency's \"cyclical vulnerability,\" as the SEK held up relatively well last week, despite bad news about Sweden's economic prospects. \n  The bank expects the krona to gradually strengthen against the euro and the dollar, but said it admits that \"current Swedish economic data hardly paints a reassuring picture for an immediate return to a stronger SEK.\" \nSTOCK INDEXES: \n \nOMXN40  1,024.81  -4.76  -0.5% \nOMXS30  1,072.48  +9.13  +0.9% \nOBX       411.19  +1.62  +0.4% \nOMXC20    473.80 -14.56  -3.0% \nOMXH25  2,099.74  +4.09  +0.2% \n \nBrent  $110.58    -$0.49  -0.5% \n \n \nNORDIC MARKETS: \n  Earnings from Swedish construction company Wallenstam AB (WALL-B.SK) and security company Securitas AB (SECU-B.SK) will be ones to watch Wednesday, equity strategist Magnus Dagel at Nordea in Stockholm said. \n  \"Securitas' report is very important, people will be looking at how its margins have developed after a very weak second quarter report, so there is some pressure on the company,\" Mr. Dagel said. \n  For Wallenstam, comments about the property market, interest rates and the development of net asset value will be eyed, according to the Nordea strategist. \n  There is little economic data expected Wednesday, but later in the week, investors can look forward to Chinese data. \n  In Denmark Wednesday, companies like brewer Carlsberg, pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck and wind turbines maker Vestas Wind Systems will be in the spotlight. \n  Carlsberg is expected to post a 11% rise in third quarter net profit helped by strong sales growth in Eastern Europe as well as Asia, a bigger market share in Russia and improved profit margins. Key focus is the Danish brewer's sales growth in Russia, raw-material cost trends and market share development. \nENERGY: \n  Crude futures Wednesday have given up a little of Tuesday's strong gains as U.S. voters went to the polls in a tightly contested national election. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 58 cents to $88.13/bbl in Asian trade after jumping 3.6% Tuesday. \"While we adhere to the theory that an Obama victory would be more bullish to the oil, gold, equity markets etc., given the likelihood of further monetary easing that would associate with a weakening in the U.S. dollar,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of advisory firm Ritterbusch & Assoc, \"we will also note that this week's price rebound has actually been led largely by Europe.\" Brent crude was lately down $0.49 at $110.58, after it had settled Tuesday at $111.07/bbl, up 3.1% following military incidents along the Yemen-Saudi border. \nNEWS ROUNDUP: \n  DENMARK: Pandora A/S (PNDORA.KO), the Danish jewelry manufacturer, Tuesday raised its revenue and margin outlook for 2012, as positive foreign exchange developments led to higher-than-expected revenue in the third quarter. \n  SWEDEN: IKEA, the Swedish furniture giant, said that total sales in its home country Sweden dipped 0.7% in the year ended Aug. 31, compared with the same period a year earlier, representing about 6% of total global sales. \n  SWEDEN: Ericsson (ERIC), the network equipment vendor, said it expects the total network equipment market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% to 5% between 2012 and 2015, and that it will continue to cut costs to boost profits. \n  NORWAY: Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR.OS), the Norwegian oil company, said that drilling of an appraisal well on the Espevaer High area of the Johan Sverdrup discovery in the Norwegian North Sea is near completion and the well results are very good \n  SWEDEN: Haldex AB (HLDX.SK), the Swedish vehicle components maker, said it expects weak demand to continue in the fourth quarter, as third-quarter revenue dropped due to a slowdown in Europe and North America. \n  NORWAY: Bakkafrost P/F (BAKKA.OS), the Oslo-listed, Faroe Island-based salmon farmer, said it expects good market conditions with rising salmon prices as it posted falling third-quarter net profit from a year earlier, weighed by a loss from the sale of a subsidiary. \n  SWEDEN: Swedish utility Vattenfall AB said its owner, the Swedish state, has announced new financial targets for the company that will be proposed at an Extraordinary General Meeting on Nov. 28, 2012. \n  SWEDEN: Nordea AB (NDA.SK), the Swedish bank, said it has signed new insurance partnerships with Tryg A/S (TRYG.KO) and If. \n  -Write to Katarina Gustafsson at katarina.gustafsson@dowjones.com \n  (Niclas Rolander in Stockholm contributed to this report.) \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 22:55 ET (03:55 GMT)","StoryId":1505172,"Headline":"NORDIC MORNING BRIEFING: Balance of Power at Stake In U.S. Vote","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352260500000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  Asian stock markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors watched early results roll in for the U.S. presidential election. \n  Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama are locked in a near-dead heat and the latest exit polls suggest a winner may not be declared until much later in the Asian trading day. Early results came in as expected, with Republican Mitt Romney winning Kentucky while President Barack Obama won Vermont. \n  A victory by Mitt Romney is seen by many as being conducive for stocks while the re-election of President Obama is better for bonds. In the short-term it is likely that stocks could get an initial boost as a major piece of political uncertainty gets wiped away. \n  \"Generally after a Presidential election, a lot of uncertainty is removed and you get a boost to markets. The question is what happens next. A Romney victory, if there is a Romney victory, would be better for shares as more uncertainty would be removed,\" said Joe Bracken, head of macro strategies at BT Investment Management in Sydney, which manages around 46 billion Australian dollars (US$48 billion). \n  The worst outcome for markets may be the lack of a clear victory -- as in 2000, where both the U.S. electorate and investors were kept waiting to find out who would be the next leader. \n  Ahead of the results, stocks in Asia were little moved, following overnight gains in both the U.S. and Europe. \n  Japan's Nikkei was down 0.1%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.2% and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4%. \n  In currencies, there was little movement early Wednesday as traders remained cautious before the results, following a quiet session on Tuesday. The U.S. dollar was weaker against the yen, at Y80.15 compared to Y80.36 late Tuesday in New York. \n  The Australian dollar softened slightly after getting a boost on Tuesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets by keeping interest rates steady. The Australian dollar was at $1.0415 compared to $1.0435 at the end of the Tuesday's session. \n  -Write to Daniel Inman at daniel.inman@wsj.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 20:35 ET (01:35 GMT)","StoryId":1505120,"Headline":"Asian Shares Mixed on Early U.S. Polls Results","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352252100000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n   By Alex Brittain \n  Euro-zone business activity shrank in October at its steepest rate in over three years, undermining hopes of an economic recovery in the fourth quarter as conditions worsened markedly in Germany, the region's biggest economy. \n  The weak outcome is further evidence that the 17 nations that use the euro are struggling to generate economic growth as governments cut spending and raise taxes to try to curb debts and end their fiscal crisis. That is likely to add to pressure on the European Central Bank to take action Thursday to support the economy, although economists on the whole don't expect the Governing Council to loosen policy yet. \n  Data company Markit said its monthly purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing and services sectors combined fell to 45.7 in October, from 46.1 in September. \n  That reading was slightly below an initial estimate for October of 45.8 published last month and pulled the index further below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. The last time the composite reading indicated a steeper fall in activity was in June 2009, when the euro zone was still in recession, having suffered five straight quarters of shrinking output. \n  October is the first month of the fourth quarter and the weak PMIs add to concern that the economy has been worsening during the period. Some official data of late have been poor. Business and consumer confidence in October fell to the weakest levels in three years, while unemployment in September rose to a record high of 11.6% of the working-age population. \"It's a tough situation in Europe, a difficult situation. It will be very slow for a while there,\" said Patrick De Maeseneire, chief executive of recruiting firm Adecco SA. \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 19:41 ET (00:41 GMT)","StoryId":1505087,"Headline":"WSJ(11/7) New Data Hit Europe Hopes For Recovery","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352248860000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n   (Adds results from Kentucky, Vermont coming in as expected in third paragraph.) \n \n  By Colleen McCain Nelson \n  A closely divided electorate, worried about the economy and the direction the country is headed, went to the polls Tuesday to decide a presidential race that has been defined by its intensity and razor-thin margins. \n  Polls began closing in Eastern-time-zone states Tuesday evening, after a day that saw long lines at many polling places around the country. Waits in some places were reported at two hours or more. \n  Early results from some strongly Republican or Democratic states came in as expected. Republican Mitt Romney won Kentucky while President Barack Obama won Vermont. \n  Most voters rated the condition of the nation's economy as \"not so good\" or \"poor,\" and a slight majority said the country is \"seriously off on the wrong track,\" according to an early wave of exit polls released Tuesday. \n  But the first glimpse of the 2012 electorate yielded conflicting messages, as many previous polls had, with a small majority saying that they have a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama. Fewer voters held favorable opinions of Mr. Romney, the exit polls found, and just over half said the Republican's policies favored the rich. \n  Early exit surveys also revealed a divided electorate in the states that will decide the winner of this election. In Ohio, perhaps the biggest prize among the swing states, voters were nearly evenly split on the question of who would better handle the economy, and a majority said former president George W. Bush was more to blame than Mr. Obama for current economic problems. \n  In Florida, the two candidates had similar favorability ratings, but more voters said Mr. Romney was the better choice for handling the economy. In Virginia, just over half of voters had positive feelings about the Obama administration, but Mr. Romney still had the edge on the question of handling the economy. \n  Messrs. Romney and Obama entered Election Day locked in a near-dead heat, with both candidates expressing confidence that their supporters would deliver a win. Ultimately, voters in a handful of battleground states will have the final say in what has been the most expensive presidential contest in history. Polls suggest that decision day could stretch into a long night. \n  Voters in many places encountered lines. At an elementary school in Fulton County, Ga., they snaked through the gymnasium and out into the hallway, and some people waited more than two and a half hours to vote. \n  In Manassas, Va., poll worker Maurica Rodgers, who has volunteered at the site for 15 years, watched the line of hundreds of voters and said, \"This is the most I've seen for a presidential election.\" At a Burbank, Calif., church, two dozen people were waiting to vote before the polls even opened, poll workers said. \n  Scattered problems with voting machines and poll watchers were reported across the country, mostly of the kind that are typically seen on Election Day. \n  Mr. Romney continued to press his case during the final hours before the polls closed, flying to Ohio to visit a campaign office in Richmond Heights with running mate, Paul Ryan. Mr. Romney also made a stop in Pennsylvania Tuesday. \n  \"We are about to change America - to help people in ways that they didn't imagine they could be helped with good jobs and better take-home pay,\" Mr. Romney told supporters at the office near Cleveland. \"The country has been going in the wrong direction, we are going to steer it back onto a course that it going to help the American people have a brighter future.\" \n  Vice President Joe Biden headed to Cleveland as well, making an unannounced stop in the coveted battleground of Ohio on his way to Chicago for election night. \n  The president was off the trail Tuesday, spending the day in Chicago after making his final swing through tossup states on Monday. Mr. Obama stopped at a local campaign office and made one last pitch to battleground states with radio and television interviews Tuesday, and he planned to continue his tradition of playing an Election Day basketball game. \n  As Mr. Romney prepared to depart for Cleveland Tuesday morning, his chief strategist, Stuart Stevens, predicted that the Republican nominee would win Ohio and dismissed suggestions that campaigning in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Election Day was a sign of concern. \n  \"I never thought that going out and talking to voters and working was anything but what we are supposed to do,\" Mr. Stevens said. \n  The Republican nominee had been riding a wave of momentum after the first presidential debate, but polls show his rise tapering off and the president regaining his footing in recent days. \n  In a radio interview Tuesday morning, Mr. Romney said his path to victory would run through Virginia. He declined to say which states would end up in his column Tuesday night but predicted that Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota all would be close. \n  \"I believe I'm going to win, but I can't tell you which state is going to be the one that puts me over the edge,\" Mr. Romney told WMAL in Washington, D.C. \n  The president said Tuesday that he's \"cautiously optimistic\" that he'll secure a second term if enough people turn out to vote. \n  \"I think that people just feel like we want to protect the changes that we've already made and we've got to keep pushing forward,\" Mr. Obama said in a radio interview that aired on the Steve Harvey show Tuesday morning. \n  More than 30 million people already have cast ballots, but the two campaigns are counting on their ground game and a final, Election Day push to determine the winner. \n  The race was tight from the start. And now that nearly $3 billion has been funneled into attack ads, super-PAC expenditures and get-out-the-vote efforts, many polls show a contest that is too close to call. The final Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey of likely voters showed Mr. Obama leading by a hair, 48% to 47%. \n  Polls give the president a slight edge in several key battlegrounds, but many are within the margin of error. \n  For both candidates, the goal is the same: accumulate 270 electoral votes. Mr. Obama appears to have more paths to reach that number, but Romney campaign officials point to the Republican nominee's strength with independent voters and the intensity of his support as evidence that Election Day could break his way. \n  Tuesday started with Mr. Biden casting his ballot in Delaware. Mr. Romney voted in Massachusetts Tuesday morning, and Mr. Ryan was in his home state of Wisconsin to vote. Mr. Obama became the first president to vote early when he cast a ballot on Oct. 25. \n  By 7:30 a.m., the wait to vote at Short Pump Middle School in Glen Allen, Va., was 30 minutes. Four years ago, there was no wait, said 42-year-old Daniel Hark as he walked to his car in the packed parking lot, having cast his ballot for Mr. Romney. \n  \"To see this many people out this early makes you think there's a lot more enthusiasm than there was four years ago,\" Mr. Hark said. \n  In Pittsburgh, a heavily Democratic city that Mr. Romney plans to visit Tuesday, voters were turning out early. By 9 a.m. nearly 40% of voters in Pittsburgh's 14th ward, the largest in the city and second-largest in the state, had already cast their votes, according to Sam Hans-Greco, chairman of the ward's Democratic committee. \n  Several voters at a polling station in the city's tree-lined East End said they wanted to give Mr. Obama another term to continue his economic policies. \n  \"I think Barack Obama is actually doing as good a job as anyone could with the position he found,\" said Dan Droz, 62, a marketing consultant. \n  -Kris Maher, Cameron McWhirter, Ryan Tracy and Tamara Audi contributed to this article \n  Write to Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 19:18 ET (00:18 GMT)","StoryId":1505082,"Headline":"WSJ UPDATE: Long Lines as U.S. Voters Flock to Polls","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352247480000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  U.S. stocks closed higher Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% to 13246, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 11 points to 1428, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 12 points to 3012. Among the companies with shares actively trading after hours are Plexus Corp. (PLXS), LivePerson Inc. (LPSN) and News Corp. (NWSA, NWS) \n  Plexus Corp. (PLXS) disclosed its disengagement as a supplier to Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR), which was its biggest customer. Shares sank 23% to $21.50 after hours. \n  LivePerson Inc.'s (LPSN) third-quarter profit fell 41% as the company's costs increased, masking higher revenue. Shares dropped 14% to $12.67 in after-hours trading as the company also lowered its earnings and revenue outlook for the year. \n  News Corp.'s (NWSA, NWS) earnings tripled in the three months to September, thanks to a one-time gain from an asset sale and higher cable-network revenue that offset weakness in the publishing group. Class A shares were up 2.1% to $24.80 after hours as per-share earnings were better than analyst estimates. News Corp. owns Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newswire, and The Wall Street Journal. \n  Procera Networks Inc.'s (PKT) third-quarter earnings jumped 35% as the technology company's product sales and margins continued to strengthen. Shares jumped 9.8% to $22.27 as adjusted profits easily topped Wall Street estimates. \n  Buckle Inc.'s (BKE) board authorized a special dividend of $4.50 a share, as the youth-geared apparel retailer looks to boost shareholder value. The payout is double the $2.25 special dividend the company paid in October 2011. Shares rose 5% to $50 after hours. \n \n   Regular Session Movers: \n \n  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS, $5.66, +$0.34, +6.39%) said it is raising prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by $50 a ton, effective immediately. The U.S. steelmaker has struggled recently against low prices, heavy competition and weak global demand. Dahlman Rose and Co. said the price increase is consistent with its bullish view on steel in the near term, as the investment bank noted firming global prices. United States Steel Corp. (X, $22.26, +$1.13, +5.35%) shares were also up. \n  Internet pioneer AOL Inc. (AOL, $43.70, +$7.89, +22.03%) looked to at last have turned a corner in the third quarter, logging its first increase in search and contextual revenue in three years. Overall results from AOL, which has been working for some time to refashion itself into an advertising-driven media business, also topped Wall Street expectations. \n  BroadSoft Inc. (BSFT, $29.81, -$6.98, -18.97%) topped earnings estimates for the third quarter, but shares fell after the software company also forecast a wide-ranging earnings performance for the fourth quarter that was mostly below Wall Street expectations. \"We think continued uncertainty on the spending environment and concern that the company's new cloud offering could cannibalize sales of the core product remain obstacles that will likely limit performance in the near-term,\" said Wedbush analysts in a note to clients. \n  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC, $15.49, -$1.04, -6.29%) swung to a third-quarter loss on rising costs to retire debt and reported a modest decline in video subscribers during a period that typically is weak because of seasonal factors. The earnings report came as Cablevision works to restore service across areas hit by Sandy, including in its backyard market of Long Island. \n  J2 Global Inc. (JCOM, $30.29, +$0.06, +0.20%) made public a rejected $270 million takeover bid for Carbonite Inc. (CARB, $9.09, +$1.04, +12.92%) that it had made two months ago, while also reporting a 9.9% stake in the online data storage company. \n  Information-technology firm Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC, $36.80, +$5.34, +16.97%) swung to a stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profit and raised its earnings target for the year well above Wall Street forecasts. \"Given the magnitude of the F2Q beat, at first glance even this higher guidance would seem to be conservative,\" said Jefferies analysts. \n  Covance Inc.'s (CVD, $54.82, +$4.20, +8.30%) third-quarter earnings fell 7.1% amid restructuring costs and other charges, but the company reported continued revenue growth in its late-stage development business. \n  CVR Energy Inc.'s (CVI, $37.69, +$1.91, +5.34%) third-quarter profit nearly doubled as the petroleum company recorded a strong performance from its refining operations. Results topped analyst expectations. \n  EOG Resources Inc.'s (EOG, $121.98, +$5.17, +4.43%) third-quarter profit fell 34% as the natural-gas-and-oil producer posted a rise in expenses that overshadowed stronger revenue. But results markedly beat Wall Street estimates. \n  Express Scripts Holding Co.'s (ESRX, $55.15, -$7.73, -12.29%) third-quarter earnings rose 21%, helped by the pharmacy-benefit manager's purchase of Medco Health Solutions, but the company tempered expectations for what could be a challenging year ahead. Citing various pressures linked to a sluggish U.S. economy, the St. Louis-based company said Wall Street expectations for 2013 look \"overly aggressive.\" \n  Needham said following a fiscal first-quarter report from Fabrinet (FN, $12.75, +$3.05, +31.44%), in which the network-equipment maker beat initial expectations that had since been lowered following the company's cautious August view, there's finally clarity on where Fabrinet is headed. \"The outlook looks better than the average optical company,\" the investment bank adds in upgrading Fabinet to buy and setting a $14 price target. \"We think a combination of solid programs and margin leverage make FN attractive at these rock-bottom price levels.\" \n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 18:13 ET (23:13 GMT)","StoryId":1505074,"Headline":"US HOT STOCKS: Plexus, LivePerson, News Corp Active in Late Trading","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352243580000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n     2227 GMT  [Dow Jones] ASIA OUTLOOK: Regional stock markets are likely biased up after stocks on Wall Street closed higher Tuesday, with the Dow booking a triple-digit point gain. However, investors may remain cautious as they await the results of the U.S. presidential election which will likely emerge during Asian trading hours. In FX markets, activity may be light before the U.S. presidential election results emerge as investors will want to weigh the financial market implications of the outcome as well as the implications for the looming fiscal cliff. Focus later may fall on a Greek parliamentary vote on a new round of austerity measures, which could be key for whether the country will receive the next tranche of its bailout loan from international creditors. The EUR/USD is at 1.2812 from 1.2816 late Tuesday in New York, the EUR/JPY is at 102.95 from 102.99, and the USD/JPY is at 80.37 from 80.36. On the data slate there's Australia's November DEEWR leading indicator of employment at 0300 GMT. Elsewhere there's Germany's September industrial production.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n   By Nicole Hong \n \n  The dollar held steady against major currencies Tuesday as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the U.S election. \n  The dollar edged higher against the yen to Y80.36 from Y80.30 late Monday. The euro rose to $1.2816 from $1.2795. \n  Investors held back from placing any big currency bets until the results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections. Trading volume was low during the New York session, analysts said, as currency markets were stuck in limbo. \n  \"We'll go home pretty flat today and figure out what we will do next tomorrow after the elections,\" said John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Consulting, a provider of foreign-exchange and international payment services. \n  The election outcome has heavy implications for the looming \"fiscal cliff\" and the U.S. dollar. If Congress fails to reach a comprehensive debt negotiation before Jan. 1, automatic spending cuts and tax increases will be triggered. Given the significant differences between the two U.S. presidential candidates' economic policies, Barclays analysts say this is \"a particularly important election in terms of potential short-run effects\" for markets. \n  The euro will also be in focus Wednesday as Greece's parliament votes on a new round of austerity measures, which could be key for whether the country will receive the next tranche of its bailout loan from international creditors. \n  \"Concerns about Europe have cropped up again in a more problematic way than a month or two ago,\" said Robert Lynch, head of G10 currency strategy at HSBC. \"There's still a lack of confidence in holding the euro that leaves it a bit more vulnerable at these lower levels.\" \n  The Australian dollar was the biggest mover among major currencies, rallying to a five-week high against the U.S. dollar after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised the markets by keeping its key interest rate steady at 3.25%. It last traded at $1.0435, up from $1.0365 late Monday. \n  Analysts at J.P. Morgan expect the Australian currency to rise to $1.06 next year as China's economic slowdown stabilizes. The Australian dollar is likely to stay well-supported even as the U.S. fiscal cliff drama unfolds because while Australia exports to the U.S., China is a much bigger trading partner to Australia, said Kevin Hebner, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan. \n  The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, dipped to 70.443 from 70.556. \n  --Anusha Shrivastava contributed to this article. \n  Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 17:04 ET (22:04 GMT)","StoryId":1505064,"Headline":"WORLD FOREX: Dollar Holds Steady Ahead of U.S. Election Outcome","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352239440000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  --Currency gains 0.6% against the U.S. dollar \n  --Markets await the U.S. election results \n  --Inflation data for October due Thursday \n  MEXICO CITY--The Mexican peso closed firmer against the U.S. dollar Tuesday as Americans headed to the polls to pick a President. \n  The peso was quoted closing in Mexico City at MXN12.9645, according to Infosel, compared with MXN13.0440 at the close Monday. \n  \"The peso is gaining amid more optimism in the markets that the U.S. will finally avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for early next year,\" said Banorte forex strategist Juan Carlos Alderete. \n  A re-election of President Barack Obama is widely seen as neutral to positive for the peso, while a victory of the Republican candidate Mitt Romney is seen as negative. \n  \"In terms of MXN, the market is talking up underperformance of MXN in the scenario of a Romney victory and on the expectation of significant changes in the US Fed. While this scenario would likely have a negative impact on all risk assets, the emphasis on Mexico is tied to positioning risk especially where foreign holdings of local fixed income are concerned given already stretched positioning on FX,\" RBS said in a report. \n  Most surveys suggest Mr. Obama went into Election Day with a narrow advantage over Mr. Romney in most battleground states. \n  The Mexican currency has proved very sensitive to changing moods in global financial markets as the currency is highly liquid and traded around the clock, with 75% of global peso trading done between foreign players. \n  This week, the macroeconomic attention in Mexico will be on inflation data for October due Thursday at 9 a.m. EDT. The consensus is expecting the annual inflation rate to fall for the first time in five months, lowering the probability of a rate increase in Latin America's second-largest economy. \n  Write to Juan Montes at juan.montes@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 16:56 ET (21:56 GMT)","StoryId":1505063,"Headline":"Mexican Peso Gains As U.S. Goes to Polls","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352238960000)\/"}}

Those losses were offset by a 2% rise in the CPO shares of television and communications company Televisa (TV, TLEVISA.MX), which closed at MXN60.18, and a 0.8% rise in banking group Banorte O shares to MXN72.55. \n  Santander Mexico (BSMX, SANMEX.MX) shares closed down 0.6% to MXN36.93. UBS started coverage of Sanmex with a neutral rating, saying that although it's Mexico's most profitable bank, \"fundamental upside [is] already priced in.\" \n  \"We like the industry's attractive structural and cyclical potential as well as the bank's balance sheet strength and earnings track record. However, we think the stock is fairly priced, especially following the +18.3% run-up in the stock's performance since the bank's 26 September 2012 IPO,\" UBS added. \n  America Movil on Tuesday launched its fourth-generation wireless service in nine Mexican cities, with plans to expand to 26 cities by April of next year.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  --Novelis keeps capital spending steady as it freezes hiring, some other costs \n  --CEO upbeat on long-term aluminum outlook despite current China, Europe slowdown \n  --Novelis net income fell 59% to $49 million during three months ended in September \n  (Adds executive comments, detail on Novelis spending plan, quarterly net income, Chinese export concern and demand outlook.) \n \n   By Matt Day \n \n  Novelis Inc. is sticking to its global expansion plans despite a set of global economic headwinds, the chief executive of the aluminum-products maker said Tuesday. \n  Novelis, which makes aluminum for beverage cans, automobiles, consumer electronics and other uses, enacted a freeze on hiring and other spending in October due to concerns about economic growth, CEO Phil Martens said in an interview. \n  \"There's a little bit of worry in every part of the world,\" he said, highlighting the planned expiration of tax cuts and new government spending curbs set to take effect in the U.S., slowing growth in China, and Europe's lingering banking crisis. Novelis' spending restraints also include a freeze on discretionary and travel spending, and a review of consulting contracts. \n  \"In the Asian market, we are seeing the effect of the Chinese slowdown,\" Mr. Martens said. Some Chinese aluminum-products makers were running below capacity because of weaker-than-expected domestic demand, he said, pushing some to consider exporting to other markets in Asia. \n  Mr. Martens said he didn't expect China's slowdown to get much worse, and was forecasting modest improvement in six to nine months. \n  But the Atlanta company hasn't slowed its expansion plans. Mr. Martens said Novelis still expects to spend $650 million to $700 million in the fiscal year that started in April to expand rolling mills in Brazil and South Korea and auto-focused plants in the U.S. and China. \n  \"We don't have to slow down any capital projects and we will not do that,\" Mr. Martens said. He added that Novelis was operating near capacity. \n  The company has said it plans to capitalize on projected rising demand for the lightweight metal in high-tech applications in automobiles and electronics while moving away from lower-margin businesses such as foil. \n  Novelis, a unit of Indian aluminum and copper producer Hindalco Industries Ltd. (500440.BY), reported a 59% drop in net income during the three months ended in September as income at its Asian and European units each fell 20%. \n  Net income was $49 million, down from $120 million during the same period a year earlier. Excluding special items, income was $62 million, down from $129 million in 2011. \n  Shipments of aluminum rolled products totalled 719,000 metric tons during the quarter, nearly flat compared to shipments of 720,000 tons a year earlier. \n  Write to Matt Day at matt.day@dowjones.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 16:10 ET (21:10 GMT)","StoryId":1505052,"Headline":"UPDATE: Novelis Holding to Growth Plan Despite Economic Worries","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352236200000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n   --Option traders look for gains in insurers and a drop for hospital operators \n   --Trading volume surges as election-day bets wager on weakening of health-care reform \n   --Big trades see Humana adding as much as 11% and HCA Holdings slipping as much as 17% \n \n   By Kaitlyn Kiernan \n \n  NEW YORK--Americans are heading to the polls, but some option traders aren't waiting for the results to set up positions on health-care names. \n  Option traders Tuesday were betting hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) could slip and health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM) rise over the next two weeks--outcomes some see as likely if Mitt Romney wins the White House and follows through on his promise to repeal President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health-care overhaul. \n  \"There seems to be near-term directional betting based on the potential outcome of the election,\" said Stephen Solaka, managing partner at Belmont Capital Group. \"There isn't a lot of time left until these options expire, but it seems to be consistent with how the stocks are moving today.\" \n  Health insurers such as Humana are expected to benefit should Mr. Romney win the election and roll back the president's health-care law. While the law promises more customers for insurers by extending coverage to millions of Americans, it also threatens to squeeze profit margins with new requirements like coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. \n  Hospital stocks such as HCA, on the other hand, would likely benefit from a victory by Mr. Obama, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. strategist Thomas Lee wrote in a note. Hospital stocks are expected to benefit from the president's health-care legislation, as it would minimize potential losses from uninsured patients. \n  Humana shares added 69 cents, or 0.9%, to $76.21 on Tuesday, though the insurer has traded mostly sideways over the past month. Meanwhile, HCA shares slipped $1.32, or 4.1%, to $30.89. \n  One trader in Humana options Tuesday made a big bet that the health insurer's shares could add as much as 10% by the end of next week using a strategy known as a \"call spread.\" \n  The investor bought about 10,000 Humana November $80 call options and sold the same number of November $85 call options to help finance the trade. That bet gives the trader the right to buy about one million Humana shares for $80 a share before expiration Nov. 17. Call options grant the right to buy shares at a set price by a designated date. \n  The bet maximizes profits at about $4.25 million should the shares add more than 11% to $85 a share, and needs Humana shares to jump at least 6% to $80.75--the strike price plus the cost to set up the trade--to break even. Should the stock rise above $85 a share, the trader could be obligated to sell the shares at that price because of the call options sold at that level. \n  Meanwhile, a similar big bet in HCA options known as a \"put spread\" looks for the hospital operator to drop as much as 17% by the end of next week. \n  The trade with put options, which convey the right to sell shares, involved the purchase of 16,000 November $29.50 put options and the sale of 18,000 November $25.50 puts to help finance the trade. The trade, which grants the right to sell 1.6 million shares at $29.50, cost about 70 cents a share. \n  That means the trade reaches a maximum profit of $5.28 million should the shares drop 17% to $25.50, and looks for a fall of at least 6.8% to break even. Should the shares fall below $25.50, the trader could be obligated to buy back 1.8 million shares at that price. Selling the November $25.50 puts granted the right to sell shares at that price to another trader. \n  Another trader in HCA options set up a similar bet, buying the November $29.50 put options but selling November $27.50 put options. While that bet narrows the maximum profit potential by selling put contracts with a higher strike price, it also reduced the overall cost of the trade, to just 28 cents a share. \n  Trading in Humana and HCA options Tuesday jumped to about four and five times the average daily trading volumes, respectively, over the past month, according to option data firm Trade Alert. \n  -Write to Kaitlyn Kiernan at kaitlyn.kiernan@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 15:22 ET (20:22 GMT)","StoryId":1505039,"Headline":"OPTIONS REPORT: Traders' Health-Care Bets Based on Romney Win","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352233320000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n    By Prabha Natarajan \n \n  Emerging-market currencies got a boost Tuesday afternoon along with other risk assets on the belief markets will benefit from the end to uncertainty on the U.S. presidency. \n  This was a sharp reversal from Monday's weakening of emerging-market currencies, when investors had turned cautious and stayed out of the market. \n  Tuesday, investors took the opportunity to buy these higher-yielding currencies on the dip in anticipation of at least a modest emerging-market rally in the short term, as the end of the election will take at least one risk off the table. There are no clear guidelines on what to expect, but a New York-based foreign-exchange trader at a major bank said expectations were for dollar weakness if President Barack Obama won and dollar strength if Mitt Romney won. \n  The fear, some market participants said, would be a contested election. \n  \"Really the worst-case scenario for the markets would be if we had a contested election,\" said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, strategist with RBS. \"The market just wants to move on.\" \n  The South African rand led the gainers' chart with a 1.29% advance to the dollar at ZAR8.611, according to CQG data. \n  Capital flows into South African equities and bonds have remained resilient, offering a chance for the South African rand to pick up at least in the short term, said analysts at Credit Agricole in a note. The rand depreciated sharply as its mining conflict escalated and its unemployment numbers remained bleak. However, the currency has overshot its fair value, and is expected to trade between ZAR8.55 and ZAR8.75 to the dollar in the next few weeks, they said. They recommend buying two-month USD/ZAR puts with a target of ZAR8.3956. \n  Other proxies for emerging-market confidence such as the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira also made big gains on the day. \n  Market participants are uncertain as to how to position in the Mexican currency given the economy's close ties to the U.S. A shrinkage of the U.S. economy could deal a blow to Mexico's economy too. Still, most investors think the peso is undervalued and are bullish on its medium- and long-term prospects. The USD/MXN is down 0.8% on the day at 12.9402, CQG data show. \n  Ahead of the U.S. elections, over the past month, central banks and global investors have diversified their holdings to include more of the Korean won. The South Korean Financial Supervisory Service has said Norway was the home of those who bought KRW348 billion in bonds last month, the largest buyers for the third-straight month, bringing its 2012 total to KRW3.473 trillion, according to a Societe Generale report. Switzerland, Chile and other central banks were also said to be sizable buyers of these bonds. \n  Meanwhile, emerging-market issuers continued to tap the market. Caribbean Development Bank sold a $300 million, 15-year bond, while Seringueira Leasing sold 2024 notes guaranteed by the Export Import Bank of the U.S. \n  Santander Mexico was in the market with a $1 billion, 10-year bond that launched at a tighter level than its initial price talk. Sasol Ltd. (SOL.JO, SSL), a South African chemical company, also had a similar move on its 10-year bond expected to be priced later in the day. \n  --Erin McCarthy contributed to this article. \n  Write to Prabha Natarajan at prabha.natarajan@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 15:13 ET (20:13 GMT)","StoryId":1505036,"Headline":"Emerging-Market Currencies Gain as Americans Head to Vote","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352232780000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  --Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio counts drug makers as top holdings \n  --Fund manager sees long-term pluses for sector despite near-term patent challenges \n  --Manager isn't focused on election outcome for health care \n \n   By Jon Kamp \n \n  While expectations ahead of Tuesday's presidential election has been influencing health-care stocks, the outcome isn't likely to change the fundamental challenge and potential risk of heavy health-care spending in the U.S., said Eddie Yoon, manager of Fidelity Investments's Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (FSPHX). \n  Mr. Yoon has steered the $2.5 billion fund toward areas where he sees long-term promise, such as pharmaceuticals, and away from areas like hospitals that are heavily exposed to government funding. These bets are based on a big-picture view of where health care is headed, and not who is inaugurated in January. \n  \"It doesn't really matter who wins,\" Mr. Yoon said. Either way, \"there is no way health care can continue to grow at this rate,\" he said. \n  Morningstar Inc. rates the fund at three out of a possible five stars. The fund has posted positive returns of 20.9% so far this year, which about six percentage points better than returns in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The fund has slightly outperformed its peer group over that span, according to Morningstar. \n  The fund has returned 17.6% on a three-year basis and 6.3% over five years, also outpacing the broader stock market by a wide span and peers by a thinner margin in those periods, Morningstar said. \n  Despite such sharply better performance compared with the broader market, there are risks involved in betting on any one sector, should sentiment for that sector sour. Industry-specific funds like this one are often a \"satellite holding\" for investors who like specific sectors and want to let fund managers do the stock picking, said Robert Goldsborough, a Morningstar fund analyst. \n  The Select Health Care Portfolio holds roughly 100 stocks, and nearly a third of assets are invested in the top five, which are all drug companies. Recent Fidelity records show biotechnology drug maker Amgen Inc. (AMGN) as the top holding, followed by Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). \n  Mr. Yoon said the concentration of drug makers is a newer phenomenon, but added, \"I think it's going to be part of the fund for a while.\" \n  Drug makers have faced well-known challenges from patents expiring for top products, as well as investor questions about whether drug-development pipelines are efficiently filling the holes. Mr. Yoon acknowledged the industry has faced a \"substantial amount of fundamental pressure.\" \n  But he sees long-term pluses, such as exposure to an emerging middle class around the world. Mr. Yoon also likes an increasing focus on biotechnology drugs, which are harder to copy than so-called small-molecule drugs. \"The barriers to entry are a lot higher and the cash flow streams are a lot more reliable,\" Mr. Yoon said. \n  The top-five holdings have all risen by between 15% and nearly 66% this year, with Gilead leading the pack due to high investor expectations for a new four-in-one HIV treatment and the potential for investigational hepatitis C drugs. \n  More recently, a flock to safety in large pharmaceutical companies helped the S&P Healthcare index outperform the broader S&P 500 in October despite \"generally lackluster\" health-care earnings reports, Raymond James said. Managed-care stocks also helped, the firm noted. \n  The Fidelity fund recently counted UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)--the largest managed-care company by both membership and revenue--as its sixth-largest holding. \n  Health insurers have been trading on investor expectations for what the election might mean for President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul law, which Mitt Romney has said he would repeal if elected. The law could give insurers millions of new customers by expanding coverage through Medicaid and state-based exchanges, but while squeezing margins through coverage requirements such as taking on people with pre-existing conditions. \n  Mr. Yoon doesn't think Mr. Romney can do away with the law, but he does think the Republican could make it more industry-friendly. But he sees a role for good managed-care companies under any scenario. \n  His fund also has holdings in other big managed-care firms such as Cigna Corp. (CI), Humana Inc. (HUM), Aetna Inc. (AET) and WellPoint Inc. (WLP). He has little exposure to smaller Medicaid-focused insurers, however, amid uncertainty about how well they'll capitalize on an emerging market for so-called dual-eligible patients who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. These are often very expensive patients with significant health problems. \n  (Jon Kamp covers health insurers for Dow Jones Newswires.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  --Brazil's Ibovespa stocks index 2.18% higher at 59,477 points \n  --U.S., European stocks, global commodities on the rise Tuesday \n  --But Brazil's own long-term growth prospects still cloudy \n  By Tom Murphy \n  SAO PAULO--Brazilian share prices rose sharply Tuesday, tracking gains for U.S. and European stocks and global commodities. \n  The benchmark Ibovespa stocks index closed 2.18% higher at 59,477 points. Volume was moderate at 5.46 billion Brazilian reais ($2.7 billion). \n  In Brazil, investors took their cue from the U.S. and Europe, where stocks rose. European investors were cheered by good corporate earnings reports. In the U.S., investors are increasingly hopeful the results of Tuesday's presidential election will be known a few hours after the polls close. An early close of the election results will help investors get a better idea of U.S. fiscal and monetary policies for the next few months and maybe even years. \n  Global commodities prices also rose Tuesday in the wake of a stronger euro. Many Brazilian companies are exporters of commodities. \n  But Brazil's own long-term growth prospects remain cloudy. \n  The HSBC bank's October purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for services showed a downturn to 50.4 points from 52.8 in September. HSBC economists said the downturn in the figure was unexpected. \n  In a report for clients, economists at giant domestic bank Itau (ITUB, ITUB4.BR) were cautious about Brazil's ability to post a convincing economic rebound in the fourth quarter. They noted continued high levels of consumer indebtedness, distortions in government tax incentive programs and a history of over-investment by some companies as question marks for growth in the next few months. \n  Blue chips were broadly higher Tuesday. \n  Government-run oil company Petrobras (PBR, PETR4.BR) gained 2.07% to close at BRL21.68 on rising international oil prices. \n  Mining giant Vale (VALE, VALE5.BR) rose 0.73% to BRL37.20 as global metals prices rose. \n  Steel companies also did well. Usiminas (USIM5.BR) was up 6.8% to BRL10.97. \n  Banks were also winners. State-run Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.BR) gained 2.5% to close at BRL23.00. \n  Telephone stock was also up. Oi (OIBR4.BR) advanced 0.85% to close at BRL8.31. \n  But utilities were still mostly in the cellar after the government release last week of details on new plans for concessions, investments and rates. Many utilities executives have said the new rates policy, in particular, will make it harder for utilities to earn profits. \n  Minas Gerais utility Cemig (CIG, CMIG4.BR) was down 0.25% to BRL24.15. Sao Paulo utility Eletropaulo (ELPL4.BR) was off 0.67% at BRL16.29. \n  Write to Tom Murphy at tom.murphy@dowjones.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 14:31 ET (19:31 GMT)","StoryId":1505028,"Headline":"Brazil Stocks Close Sharply Higher, Tracking Europe, U.S.","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352230260000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  13:59 EST - Venezuela's tightly controlled FX system has offered more currency at a weaker VEF5.3/dollar peg this year compared to 2011, says local consultancy Sintesis Financiera. The central bank's SITME platform, which offers the weaker rate, distributed more than 50% additional dollars through September while the larger FX agency Cadivi, with a peg of VFEF4.3/dollar, has distributed only 4.6% more. Cadivi remains prominent, having injected $22.9B into the economy through September compared to SITME's $6.8B. But many experts see SITME's expansion as initial tinkering before a formal--and much larger--devaluation in 2013.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  --Brazil real exits active trading at BRL2.0318/dlr vs BRL2.0336 Monday \n  --Stronger euro, stocks, commodities prices helped support real \n  --Central bank, foreign investors sidelined ahead of U.S. elections \n \n  By Tom Murphy \n \n  SAO PAULO--The Brazilian real strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, tracking gains for the euro and higher global stocks and commodities prices. \n  The real exited active trading at BRL2.0318 to the dollar, slightly stronger against the Monday close of BRL2.0336, according to Tullet Prebon via FactSet. \n  In Europe, stocks and the euro strengthened on improved corporate earnings. A stronger euro helped propel gains for international commodities prices. Higher commodities prices favor Brazilian export revenues. \n  An overall improved tone in global trading Tuesday came as U.S. voters lined up to choose a president and members of congress. Investors are increasingly hopeful the outcome of the U.S. presidential election will become clear within a few hours of the polls closing. If so, the result will also help clarify U.S. fiscal and monetary policies for the next four years. \n  But traders in Brazil also noted that while volatility was low Tuesday, so was volume. \n  \"Trading is sideways,\" said Mauricianao Cavalcanti, a trader at Sao Paulo's Ouro Mina brokerage. \"All eyes are on the U.S. election.\" He noted that international investors and the Brazilian Central Bank were essentially sidelined Tuesday. \n  In the longer term, however, pressure for the Brazilian real to appreciate against the U.S. dollar will grow. \n  One reason is an expected global weakening of the U.S. dollar because of continued loose monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, according to a study by economists at Goldman Sachs. \n  \"Intervention to stem BRL appreciation this August and September has been as strong as in August and September 2010,\" the Goldman Sachs economists noted. \"We see the scale of intervention recently as supporting our case for BRL appreciation in the medium term.\" \n  Another reason to expect pressure for an appreciation of the Brazilian real is inflows from corporate bond issues. A number of companies, including banking giants Itau (ITUB, ITUB4.BR) and government-run mortgage bank Caixa Economica Federal, are planning bond issues. Those dollars will pour into the Brazilian foreign exchange market in the coming weeks, forcing either an appreciation of the currency or additional heavy government intervention, according to traders. \n  Brazil's government has signaled its strong intention to fight back against any significant appreciation, however. In a recent interview, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said a strong real would hurt exporters and manufacturers. \n  -Write to Tom Murphy at tom.murphy@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 13:29 ET (18:29 GMT)","StoryId":1504998,"Headline":"Brazil Real Slightly Stronger on Firm Global Markets","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352226540000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n   By Peg Brickley \n \n  NewPage Corp. on Tuesday got the nod from a judge to poll creditors on its Chapter 11 debt-restructuring plan, the first step toward hitting an end-of-year target to get out of bankruptcy. \n  Its revenues dented by the economic downturn and changes in the publishing industry, the maker of coated paper filed for Chapter 11 protection in September 2011, intent on surviving without massive layoffs. \n  If approved, the Chapter 11 balance-sheet reshaping \"should continue the employment of the 6,000 employees, and...put it on track in the commercial world totally deleveraged to survive and thrive,\" said NewPage attorney Martin Bienenstock, who is with Proskauer Rose LLP. \n  A fourth, and likely final, version of the report outlining NewPage's plan will be prepared and filed by Wednesday. It is the chief component of the package of voting materials that will be sent out in advance of a Dec. 13 Chapter 11 plan-confirmation hearing. \n  Judge Kevin Gross said Tuesday at a hearing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., that he would approve as adequate the balloting package once the final documents are before him. \n  Judge Gross also cleared NewPage to move ahead with $850 million worth of exit loans from lenders led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Barclays PLC (BARC.LN). Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and UBS AG (UBS) are also parties to the financing. The loans carry $26 million worth of fees. \n  Final approval of the financing depends on the outcome of the confirmation hearing. \n  Mr. Bienenstock said Tuesday he is hopeful there will be no major problems in securing confirmation. There is still a battle over a proposed settlement with private-equity owner Cerberus Capital Management, but that fight will take place separately in advance of confirmation. \n  First-lien lenders will swap $1.77 billion worth of debt for ownership of the coated-paper maker if NewPage's Chapter 11 plan is ultimately approved. \n  Mr. Bienenstock said letters would go out urging a \"yes\" vote on the plan from the official committee of unsecured creditors, which had long battled NewPage over its restructuring strategy. \n  Originally in for slim to no recovery, unsecured creditors dealt themselves into a share of $30 million in cash that is also being shared by second-lien bondholders, as well as a piece of the first $50 million to be raised by post-bankruptcy lawsuits. \n  \"We are supportive of the plan,\" said Paul Hastings LLP's Luc Despins, attorney for the unsecured creditors committee. \n  Unsecured creditors, however, are still planning on a showdown over the proposed settlement with Cerberus. From the start of the case, unsecured creditors have been probing the big firm for evidence that it took advantage of the distressed paper maker. \n  \"This is an insider settlement. We're in Delaware. We must establish that the settlement is fair,\" Mr. Despins said. \n  NewPage said that as long as the settlement is reasonable, it should be approved. \n  (Dow Jones Daily Bankruptcy Review covers news about distressed companies and those under bankruptcy protection.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  By Graciela Ibanez \n  The Chilean peso closed stronger against the dollar Tuesday in a quiet session ahead of the results of the U.S. presidential election. \n  The peso ended at CLP479.00 to the dollar versus Monday's close of CLP480.50, after trading in a narrow range of CLP479.00 to CLP480.60. \n  As U.S. citizens went to the polls, market participants refrained from placing any big bets ahead of the results. \n  \"Trading volume was low,\" said Francisca Roa, an analyst at Netgociando. \n  Investors are also waiting for Wednesday's parliamentary vote in Greece over austerity measures demanded by the country's international creditors. Concerns about Greece's fiscal and debt obligations have weakened the peso in previous sessions. \n  As Chile is an export-based economy, the peso often takes its cues from U.S. and European political developments, as they signal the direction of global growth. \n  In Chile, meanwhile, central bank governor Rodrigo Vergara reiterated that the peso is still aligned with its long-term fundamentals, ruling out a currency intervention. The central bank launched a yearlong intervention program when the peso firmed to CLP465.40 versus the dollar in early January 2011. \n  In recent months, exporters have been asking the central bank to intervene in the currency market to weaken the peso. \n  In the fixed-income market, yields on inflation-indexed Chilean central-bank bonds, or BCUs, ended higher tracking yields on U.S. Treasury notes with similar maturities. \n  The yield on five-year BCUs closed at 2.47%, up from 2.46% on Monday, while the yield on 10-year BCUs ended at 2.48%, up from 2.45% on the previous session. Bond yields and prices move inversely. \n  (Peso and bond quotes provided by Valor Futuro newswire.) \n  Write to Graciela Ibanez at graciela.ibanez@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 12:09 ET (17:09 GMT)","StoryId":1504967,"Headline":"Chile Peso Ends Stronger in Quiet Session Ahead of U.S. Election Results","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352221740000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n   --Enbridge, United Utilities are key holdings \n   --Sees growth in pipelines \n   --Regulator is key, manager says \n \n     By Caroline Van Hasselt \n \n  TORONTO--Utilities aren't just for widows and orphans anymore. \n  With bond yields at historic lows and equity markets volatile, regulated publicly traded utilities that offer steady, dependable income and profit growth have become highly sought-after. Big pension, private-equity and sovereign-wealth funds are snapping up good infrastructure plays, making them increasingly scarce and driving up their value. \n  \"If you own great infrastructure, it's similar to owning great real estate,\" said Jason Gibbs, manager of the Dynamic Global Infrastructure Fund, a five-star rated fund, with a three-year annualized return of 13.3% versus 4% for its peers, according to Morningstar Canada. \n  About 41% of the fund is in utilities, with another 23% in energy infrastructure and 11% in industrials and the reminder in financials, telecom and consumer discretionary stocks. Top holdings include United Utilities Group Plc (UU.LN), Transurban Group (TCL.AU), Severn Trent Plc (SVT.LN), American Tower REIT (AMT), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and TransCanada Corp. (TRP). \n  \"The beauty with pipelines is they are the toll road of the energy world,\" said Mr. Gibbs. \"They have a stable business with recurring cash flows and also a lot of growth, or more growth than you'd expect because they're building new pipelines to keep up with. It's like a rebuilding of the inter-state highway system, when you look at energy-infrastructure with shale oil, oil sands, shale gas.\" \n  He expects Enbridge's dividend to grow about 15% a year in the next five years. \n  United Utilities and Severn Trent, U.K.-based water utilities both rumored to be takeover targets, aren't going to \"blow out the lights but are incredibly defensive,\" he said. \n  The biggest risk to owning utilities is regulatory. \n  \"You can have a great utility but if your regulator is always trying to cut your returns or not allow you to pass through certain costs, then it really doesn't matter,\" said Mr. Gibbs. \"You want to have a good regulator.\" \n  That concern has kept him from investing in countries like Germany, Spain or Italy. \n  The fund once owned Italian toll road operator Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI), but changing tax policies in Italy, one of the troubled euro-zone countries, keeps him from buying it again. \"How can you buy that as an investor not knowing what the actual tax rate is going to be because the government has been changing its mind? I have no visibility into cash flows,\" he said. \n  Regulators in Canada, Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. are more reliable, even with the U.K. in a recession and the U.S. facing a fiscal cliff, he said. \"They get it,\" said Mr. Gibbs. \"When you're suffering for capital, you want to try to make yourself the most hospitable to private capital.\" \n  Write to Caroline Van Hasselt at caroline.vanhasselt@dowjones.com \n  TALK BACK: We invite readers to send us comments on this or other financial news topics.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n   By Sarka Halas \n \n  LONDON--Offering further evidence that companies are becoming less dependent on ratings firms to sell debt, unrated German software company SAP AG (SAP) launched a two-part eurobond as investors' insatiable appetite for corporate debt continues. \n  SAP is back in the market after almost a two-year hiatus with a two-part bond Tuesday. The 550 million euro ($704.26 million) bond will mature in three years and will price at 52 basis points over the reference midswaps rate, while the seven-year EUR750 million part will price at 92 basis points over the reference midswaps rate, one of the lead banks said. \n  Despite being unrated and therefore ineligible to be included in funds that follow benchmark indexes, investor demand for the bond was in excess of EUR6 billion for the EUR1.3 billion deal highlighting substantial demand among investors for the German unrated corporate debt. \n  SAP is a well recognized name and because corporate debt is relatively scarce, investors seeking a higher yield from a safe German company snapped up SAP's bond offering. \n   \"SAP will have a lower new issue premium than some of the companies that issued in October due to its superior credit quality,\" said Jeroen van den Broek, credit strategist at ING. \n   Last month, German pharmaceutical company Celesio, Italian drinks firm Davide Campari-Milano SpA, French media company Lagardere SCA and Collectivites Territoriales de France, a collective of regional funding agencies, proved that a rating isn't all that necessary in the financial markets. \n   \"The current market environment is an opportunity for less frequent issuing companies without a rating, but with comparable lower BBB credit strength, to access the market whilst not having to go through the expensive rating process,\" said Mr. van den Broek. \n  But despite the strong demand for SAP, unrated debt may be constrained as a number of investor mandates often require a bond to have at least one credit rating. \n  \"SAP hasn't been included in our European corporate bond fund. We are able to buy unrated bonds but see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" said Tom Ross, fund manager at Henderson Global Investors, adding that the firm hasn't invested in the deal because it is bearish on both hardware and software tech companies. \n  Henderson's European corporate bond fund, almost EUR1 billion in size, is able to hold up to 20% of bond that are non-euro denominated, or non-rated, or junk-rated. \n  The last time SAP was in the market was back in March 2010, when it priced a four-year and seven-year bond, those bond are currently trading at 40 and 67 basis points over the reference midswaps rate. \n  \"There has been development and maturing of the European bond markets. Its been 12 years since the inception of the euro, but only five to seven years ago we would have seen many investment mandates limited to just double A and single A rated corporate names --demand for non-rated debt was negligible,\" said Mr. van den Broek. \n  Ben Edwards contributed to this article. \n  Write to Sarka Halas at sarka.halasova@dowjones.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 11:10 ET (16:10 GMT)","StoryId":1504938,"Headline":"Investors Snap Up German Software Company SAP Unrated Bond","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352218200000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  By Anirban Chowdhury \n  MUMBAI--Banks for Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (532747.BY) have asked the cash-strapped Indian carrier to raise capital by Nov. 30, its biggest lender said Tuesday. \n  \"We have to tell them [Kingfisher Airlines] this, otherwise we have seen they are not moving ahead with plans [of fundraising],\" Pratip Chaudhuri, chairman, State Bank of India Ltd. (500112.BY), told Dow Jones Newswires. \n  Mr. Chaudhuri didn't elaborate how much money the lenders have asked the airline to raise, nor did he specify what action the banks will take if it can't do so by the deadline. \n  A Kingfisher spokesman declined to comment. \n  In late October, the airline told the country's aviation regulator that its parent UB Group and other key shareholders will put money into the carrier in three to four months, as it won't be able to raise money from external investors in that time. Its parent put in at least 11 billion rupees ($202.09 million) into the airline for the six months to the end of October. \n  Kingfisher, controlled by liquor baron Mr. Mallya, has been repeatedly told by auditors, shareholders and lenders that it needs more cash urgently if it is to remain operating. Sydney-based CAPA-Centre for Aviation says Kingfisher needs $600 million immediately and that it will cost $1 billion to turn the company around. \n  The airline has accumulated losses of $1.9 billion between May 2005 and the end of June 2012, according to another report from CAPA. It also owes about $2.5 billion to banks, leasing companies, suppliers and majority shareholders. It has defaulted on at least $150 million worth of loans, according to its latest annual report for the financial year ended March 31, 2012. \n  Kingfisher has been battered by losses, high debt and--most recently--a strike by unpaid employees that forced it to cancel flights indefinitely. Named after India's most popular brand of beer, the airline is the worst-hit airline in an industry troubled by high fuel prices and elevated interest rates. Nearly every airline in India posted losses last year. \n  Mr. Mallya has said he is in talks with foreign carriers to sell a stake in Kingfisher. He is also speaking with U.K.-based liquor company Diageo PLC (DEO) to sell a stake in group company United Spirits Ltd., as part of plans to raise cash for the airline. \n  Kingfisher has tried without success to raise funds by selling stakes in the past couple of years. \n  The airline cancelled its flights since Oct. 1 after its pilots, engineers and technicians took industrial action. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation suspended the airline's license on Oct. 20 after it failed to produce a plan on how it would revive its operations. Kingfisher later convinced its employees to join work by offering them three months' pending salaries, but the carrier hasn't turned in a revival plan yet. \n  Write to Anirban Chowdhury at anirban.chowdhury@dowjones.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 10:49 ET (15:49 GMT)","StoryId":1504923,"Headline":"Lenders Tell Kingfisher Airlines to Raise Capital by Nov 30-SBI Chairman","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352216940000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  (Updates with more detail on Germany) \n  By Alex Brittain \n  Euro-zone business activity shrank in October at its steepest rate in over three years, undermining hopes of an economic recovery in the fourth quarter, as conditions worsened markedly in the region's biggest economy Germany. \n  The weak outcome is further evidence that the 17 nations that use the euro are struggling to generate economic growth as governments cut spending and raise taxes to try to curb debts and end their fiscal crisis. That is likely to add to pressure on the European Central Bank to take action Thursday to support the economy, although economists on the whole don't expect the Governing Council to loosen policy yet. \n  Data company Markit said its monthly Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing and services sectors combined fell to 45.7 in October, from 46.1 in September. \n  That was slightly below an initial estimate for October of 45.8 published last month and pulled the index further below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. \n  The last time the composite reading indicated a steeper fall in activity was in June 2009, when the euro zone was still in recession, having suffered five straight quarters of shrinking output. \n  October is the first month of the fourth quarter and the weak PMIs add to concern that the economy has been worsening during the period. Some official data of late have been poor. Business and consumer confidence in October fell to the weakest levels in three years, damaging any prospects for a rise in spending that could fuel an economic recovery. Unemployment in September rose to a record high of 11.6% of the working-age population. \n  Recruitment firm Adecco SA said Tuesday it expects the European jobs market to stay tough for some time, as it reported a 16% drop in third-quarter sales from its biggest market, France. \"It's a tough situation in Europe, a difficult situation. It will be very slow for a while there,\" Chief Executive Patrick De Maeseneire said. \"Economies don't turn overnight.\" \n  Data for euro-zone economic growth in the third quarter aren't yet available but will be published Nov. 15. The economy shrank 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. \n  The October PMIs are consistent with the economy shrinking about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, said Markit senior economist Rob Dobson. \n  Markit said Italy, France and Spain registered more moderate rates of decline in business activity in October, with Italy's measure the least negative in seven months at 45.6. \n  German business activity didn't shrink as rapidly as in those countries, but its decline was still the steepest in two months, with a reading of 47.7. \n  \"Signs that the contraction in Germany gathered pace are particularly disappointing, given the important role a strong-performing Germany could play in stimulating growth elsewhere in the currency zone,\" Mr. Dobson said. \n  German manufacturing orders plunged in September as orders from within the euro zone declined by almost 10% from August, data from the Economics Ministry showed Tuesday. \n  Manufacturing orders overall dropped by 3.3% in real terms--well below economists' expectations for a 0.5% fall. \n  \"Orders in the third quarter point to weak industrial activity in Germany for at least the next couple of quarters and put downside risk to our forecast of an economic rebound in early 2013,\" said Barclays economist Thomas Harjes. \n  Ralph Wiechers, chief economist at German industry group VDMA, told Dow Jones Newswires the mood is muted among industrial companies, particularly car manufacturers and suppliers. \"There is still considerable uncertainty, especially about the outlook for domestic demand,\" he said. \n  VDMA predicts a sharp slowdown in machinery production in Germany this year and next, with growth of 2% expected for both years after an expansion of 12.3% in 2011. \n  Economists don't expect the ECB to take action to shore up the economy on Thursday, even though the central bank conceivably has room to cut its key interest rate further from a current record low of 0.75%. Comments from policy makers including the bank's President Mario Draghi suggest it is waiting for national governments to take action to fix their finances, after the ECB's announcement of an initiative to forcibly lower borrowing costs of struggling nations helped calm tensions in financial markets. \n  Marco Valli, chief euro zone economist at UniCredit said recent data haven't been weak enough to force the ECB to take action yet. \"Overall, the October round of surveys can be regarded as disappointing, but not bad enough to dash hopes of a more generalized turnaround in underlying [economic] momentum at the turn of the year,\" he said. \n  \"We see the central bank firmly on hold both on conventional and unconventional policy [on Thursday],\" he added. \n  Growth in euro-zone producer prices eased in September, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said Tuesday, suggesting an easing in inflationary pressures that could remove one obstacle to ECB stimulus in coming months. \n  Prices charged by euro-zone factories rose 0.2% on the month in September, slowing from a 0.9% rise in August. In year-to-year terms producer-price inflation was unchanged at 2.7%. \n  The slowdown follows a fall in consumer price inflation, the ECB's target measure, to an annual rate of 2.5% in October from 2.6% in September. The ECB expects consumer price inflation to fall below its target rate of a little less than 2% sometime next year. \n  In Markit's figures, Ireland was the only country to post growth in business activity, at least among the five for which the data firm gave detailed figures. Ireland's composite PMI rose to 55.6 in October from 53.0 in September, marking its fifth straight month of growth and the strongest since February 2011. \n  (Nina Koeppen, John Revill and Ilona Billington contributed to this article.) \n  Write to Alex Brittain at alex.brittain@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 10:38 ET (15:38 GMT)","StoryId":1504917,"Headline":"WSJ 2nd UPDATE: Data Hits Euro-Zone Recovery Hopes","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352216280000)\/"}}

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n  By Alex MacDonald \n  LONDON--Credit ratings company Moody's Investors Service Tuesday downgraded steel titan ArcelorMittal's (MT) credit rating by one notch to junk status, making it the second credit company to do so this year over concerns about weakening steel demand globally and the company's ability to reduce its debt burden. \n  Moody's downgraded ArcelorMittal's senior unsecured note ratings to Ba1 from Baa3 or investment grade and kept its negative rating outlook after the Luxembourg-based steelmaker swung to a third-quarter operating loss and reported higher debt due to $1.9 billion in negative free cashflow stemming from a deterioration in global steel markets. Moody's said it was the company's worst performance since the second quarter of 2009. \n  \"We see challenging conditions continuing for ArcelorMittal over several quarters with its operating environment more likely to get worse before it gets better,\" said Steve Oman, senior vice president and lead analyst for the EMEA steel industry at Moody's. \n  \"As a result, the amount of debt reduction the company must realize in order to hold a Baa3 rating is so large as to be unachievable or, if attempted through asset disposals, will materially impact the core operations and earnings of the company,\" he added. \n  Steelmakers have been reeling from a slump in steel prices due to weak demand in Europe and the U.S., and slower-than-expected economic growth in China. ArcelorMittal--the world's largest by volume, accounting for some 6% of global output--has responded by idling plants and selling non-core assets in order to reduce debt. \n  The measures haven't been enough to allay concerns. Standard and Poor's downgraded ArcelorMittal's credit rating by one notch to junk status in August followed by Fitch Ratings which downgraded the company's credit rating to one notch above junk status. \n  Based on Moody's future earnings expectations for ArcelorMittal, the credit company now estimates that ArcelorMittal could violate its credit facility covenant in June 2013 unless the company repays a considerable amount of debt or receives an amendment from its lenders, as it did in 2009. \n  An ArcelorMittal spokesman said in response to the latest downgrade that \"ArcelorMittal's financial position remains robust; the programs we have in place to improve our credit metrics remain on track and we expect to see further progress in the coming months.\" \n  The company's Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal previously said ArcelorMittal would continue to target an investment grade credit rating to retain access to deeper and larger pools of credit but he noted that the company wouldn't seek an investment grade credit rating at all costs. \n  He previously said a downgrade of the company's debt by one notch would only result in about $100 million in additional annual interest expenses. \n   At 1507 GMT, ArcelorMittal's shares were up 1% at EUR11.98, resulting in a market capitalization of EUR18.5 billion. \n  Write to Alex MacDonald at alex.macdonald@dowjones.com \nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 10:29 ET (15:29 GMT)","StoryId":1504914,"Headline":"Moody's Downgrades ArcelorMittal Credit Rating To Junk Status","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352215740000)\/"}}

An index reading above 50 indicates a faster pace of activity. \n  The report noted the survey responses were collected before Sandy hit so the storm had no effect on the data. The ISM-NY report itself, however, was delayed from Friday because of Sandy. \n  The six-month outlook index increased to 57.7 last month from an 11-month low of 56.4 in September. \n  Among the subindexes, the purchasing-volume index pulled out of contractionary territory with a gain to 52.2 from 48.4. It was the first expansionary reading since June. \n  The employment index fell to 47.8 from 52.8. The current revenue index dropped to 50.0 from 55.0 while the expected demand index plunged to 50.0 from 62.5. \n  Cost pressures rose further to a six-month high. The prices paid index increased to 60.4 from 58.8 in September. \n  When asked about specific business impediments, 33% of survey respondents reported no difficulties, but 29% pointed to working capital shortages. \n  In a series of special questions, the ISM-NY asked about actual expenses versus budget projections. \n  Almost half, 42%, said actual spending was in line with budgets, and 29% said expenses were running below.

{"NewsDetail":{"Story":"\n \n   By Serena Ruffoni \n \n  Investors fought Tuesday morning to grab a slice of a rare bond offering from Spanish insurer Mapfre (MAP.MC), lured by attractive pricing and scarcity value, in a further sign of improved investor confidence in companies located in fiscally frail euro-zone countries. \n  Orders from investors for the three-year bond Tuesday surpassed 2 billion euros ($2.56 billion) from over 280 accounts, the lead banks said. The deal size has been fixed at EUR1 billion. \n  \"The book size is an obvious sign that the deal is going well\" said a banker away from deal. \"However, what is interesting is the number of accounts asking to get a piece of this bond. This means that it is getting interest from a deep, diverse pool of investors, not only the Spanish ones.\" he noted. \n  Bonds from Mapfre are a rare occurrence. The company, with revenue of over EUR25 billion in 2011, doesn't fund itself often in the bond market, having historically preferred loans from banks. Only a EUR700 million subordinated bond, issued in 2007 and maturing in 2037 and a $300 million senior bond issued in 2003 and maturing in September next year are available for credit investors willing to have exposure in the company. \"For sure, the scarcity value of this bond was one of the factors determining such a high level of demand\" said another banker on the deal. \n  The bond was originally marketed with a 5.25% yield. Due to strong investor demand, the lead banks have subsequently lowered the proposed yield to 5.125%. \n  Investors on this senior unsecured issue, a type of bond which isn't secured on the company's assets, can count on receiving a nice return differential compared with a Spanish government bond of a similar maturity. The Spanish bond maturing in October 2015 carries a yield of around 3.71%, according to data provider Tradeweb. \n  One analyst noted that, though the company being a \"strong business\", was nevertheless offering a bond of short maturity to appease investors concerns over Spanish fiscal imbalances. \"The only issue with this company, in my opinion, is its exposure in Spanish sovereign bonds.\" he said. \n  Mapfre has a diversified geographical presence, balanced between its home country Spain, Latin America and other countries. However, their third-quarter results were negatively affected by the company's shareholdings in troubled Spanish lender Bankia (BKIA.MC) and Italian insurer Cattolica Assicurazioni SpA (CASS.MI). In its third quarter this year, Mapfre had to write off around EUR90 million from the value of these shareholdings, according to a presentation in its website. Bankia is also a shareholder of Mapfre. \n  Bankia, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Credit Agricole, HSBC and Banco Santander are managing this bond deal. \n  The company is rated just one notch above junk, at BBB- by Standard & Poor's Corp. \n  Write to Serena Ruffoni at serena.ruffoni@dowjones.com \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n  November 06, 2012 09:55 ET (14:55 GMT)","StoryId":1504889,"Headline":"Investors Queue for Yield on Rare Spanish Insurer Mapfre Bond","PublishDate":"\/Date(1352213700000)\/"}}
