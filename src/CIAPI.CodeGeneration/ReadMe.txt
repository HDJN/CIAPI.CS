Hidden in this project are the T4 templates for generating DTO and Routes.  The (hidden) generated files are linked in the core projects

The T4 editor add-in, Clarius Visual T4 Editor for Visual Studio 2010 (http://blog.visualt4.com/2010/11/visual-t4-beta-1-is-now-available.html), is buggy and making life difficult.

Until this is resolved, if you really want to play with the templates we can talk about the ins and outs.

For now, this is just where I keep the templates to generate the code.

I think we may simply move to a freeware CodeSmith generation across the board.
